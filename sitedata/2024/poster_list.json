However, more work is needed to understand the impact of guidance on interpreting data visualizations as well as on the resulting use of visualizations when communicating insights. We conducted two user studies with domain experts and found that experts benefit from a guided coarse-to-fine structure when using data visualization systems, as this is the same structure in which they communicate findings.",

        "abstract": "Gender-based violence (GBV) is a critical human rights issue where data visualizations play an important role in educating the public about its scale and impact, and in shaping the decisions of policymakers. However, this area often suffers from missing and inconsistent data due to underreporting, lack of infrastructural support, and varying definitions of GBV across societal and cultural contexts, posing challenges for accurate visualizations. This study proposes an interdisciplinary framework for evaluating the reliability of GBV visualizations, focusing on the intersection between data quality and visual representation. The framework was applied to a representative sample of 15 countries from the World Health Organization Global Database on the Prevalence Violence against Women (VAW), the current largest visualization project on GBV. A summary dataset was produced based on the evaluation results and used to create analysis and \"meta-visualizations\" that reveal shortcomings of the visualization design and underlying data collection. The study reveals numerous limitations of the VAW project, including misleading color schemes, insufficient representation of data context and quality, and lack of diverse voices in data collection. The study calls for more culturally responsive data collection and nuanced visualization approaches to accurately portray and address GBV. The next step involves applying the framework to the remaining countries in the database and developing guidelines for more effective GBV data collection and visualization, thereby contributing to addressing GBV as a multidimensional, situated issue.",

However, most MCDM visualization tools, such as LineUp and ValueCharts, focus on quantitative data, often overlooking qualitative criteria. This gap appears to stem from a lack of studies on real-world decision making tasks. To address this, we conducted in-depth interviews with job seekers, emphasizing the integration and prioritization of qualitative data. After investigating the role of qualitative data in decision making, we introduced and evaluated a tool that extends LineUp\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s features to support qualitative criteria. Our insights underscore the vital role of qualitative data in job seeking, illustrating how visualization design can better accommodate the nuanced preferences inherent in these decision making processes.",

We focus on applications of visualization for education and outreach, where the versatility and intuitiveness of conversational agents can be leveraged to provide engaging and meaningful learning experiences. Visualization benefits from the development of LLMs by leveraging its capability to understand requests in natural language, allowing users to express complex tasks efficiently. Natural Language Interfaces can be combined with more traditional visualization interaction techniques, streamlining real-time interaction and facilitating free data exploration. We thus instructed a voice-controlled GPT-4o LLM to send commands to an OpenSpace instance, effectively providing the LLM with the the ability to steer the visualization software as a museum facilitator would for educational shows.

        "abstract": "The growing popularity of interactive time series exploration platforms has made visualizing data of public interest more accessible to general audiences. At the same time, the democratized access to professional-looking explorers with preloaded data enables the creation of convincing visualizations with carefully cherry-picked items. Prior research shows that people use data explorers to create and share charts that support their potentially biased or misleading views on public health or economic policy and that such charts have, for example, contributed to the spread of COVID-19 misinformation. Interventions against misinformation have focused on post hoc approaches such as fact-checking or removing misleading content, which are known to be challenging to execute. In this work, we explore whether we can use visualization design to impede cherry-picking---one of the most common methods employed by deceptive charts created on data exploration platforms. We describe a design space of guardrails---interventions against cherry-picking in time series explorers. Using our design space, we create a prototype data explorer with four types of guardrails and conduct two crowd-sourced experiments to evaluate them. Based on our findings, we propose recommendations for developing effective guardrails for visualizations.",

With the rise of open city data and services, gathering information at the city scale, like transportation, modeling, and predicting city events such as crime and traffic, has become feasible. Visually assessing the quality of these models requires correlating features, predictions, and ground truth both globally and locally, which is challenging with multi-attribute data due to occlusion. To address this, we introduce Layer Toggling for instantaneously changing layer visibility using a physical button box, allowing comparison of spatially coherent views using retinal persistence. Visibility-preserving lenses dynamically adjust to the density of revealed features, facilitating the exploration of spatial (2D) and quantitative data (1D), such as temporal attributes. We validate our approach on a use case visualizing urban data from S\u221a\u00a3o Paulo city across multiple data layers. Our methods support user exploration and expert analysis tasks, especially in validating and interpreting prediction algorithm outcomes at both global and local scales.",

In recent years, AR has become an increasingly popular option for conversational support, leading to many contributions in the field. However, there has been less focus on developing lightweight, non-intrusive, on-demand conversation visualizations in AR. It is important that visualizations don't distract from the conversation partner or the conversation itself. Furthermore, the information displayed may not always be relevant to the user at every moment. Therefore, we explore methodologies to dissect and visualize conversation timelines in real time, providing glanceable summarizations and breakdowns of conversations which are easily summoned and dismissed. In our prototyping, we use a combination of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to recognize and classify changes in topic. To display the visualization, we use the XReal sunglasses as a lightweight unobtrusive headset which could reasonably be worn in everyday life. We identify a unique set of visualization challenges and opportunities related to minimalist conversation visualizations. Following these explorations, we discuss our findings, and provide our initial reflections on various visualization techniques.",

Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown surprising performance in assisting data analysis and visualization. In this poster, we investigate the capabilities of LLMs for reasoning about causality between concept pairs in visualized data using line charts, bar charts, and scatterplots. By using LLMs to replicate two human-subject empirical studies about causality judgments, we how their inferences about causality between concept pairs compare to those of humans, both with and without accompanying visualizations showing varying association levels. Our findings indicate that LLMs' causality inferences are more likely to align with human results without visualizations at very high or very low causal ratings, but LLMs are more influenced by low visualized associations and relatively unaffected by high visualized associations.",

We interviewed ten participants, showing them eight stimuli scatterplots to investigate variation among participants' high-level comprehension. Participants described each of the tested graphs using natural language. The descriptions were coded using axial coding to identify their alignments with the designer's intentions. The results revealed that high-level comprehension could be of four levels: basic reading of the graph, conceptual understanding, common graph knowledge, and statistics and patterns. Our findings show that by understanding individual's differences in comprehension levels, visualization designers can enhance the accessibility and effectiveness of their visualizations, ensuring that they communicate information more effectively to people with diverse backgrounds and expertise levels.",

        "abstract": "Dimensionality reduction is a widely adopted tool in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Techniques such as Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) transform high-dimensional embeddings of text data into a lower-dimensional space for visualization. Two-dimensional plots of these embeddings aid in developing insights into model performance. To make sense of these plots, users need to inspect the underlying text represented by the points which can be time-consuming and cognitively intensive. To address this challenge, we developed a novel approach for summarizing and analyzing data behind user selections in text embedding plots. Our interactive approach involves allowing the user to make selections on the text embedding and then utilizing a large-language model (LLM) for: getting a quick overview of the selection, identifying instances of miss-classification, understanding text data within a mixed-class selection, and suggesting additional labels that better fit the underlying text. We implemented our approach in a prototype application, Text-Embedding Selection Sidekick (TESS), and present our initial results.",

Crowd-sourced studies likely would also benefit from think-aloud, but the increased technical overhead, as well as the uncertainty of how participants may react to being asked to speak without a researcher present, have restricted think-aloud to in-person studies. To address this problem, we introduce CrowdAloud, a user study platform for creating and analyzing crowd-sourced think-aloud studies. Utilizing audio and task-level provenance data, CrowdAloud provides the necessary conditions for think-aloud studies to be run as well as a qualitative analysis conducted on the results, without the technical overhead involved with an ad-hoc solution. To evaluate the comparability of in-person and crowd-sourced studies, we conduct two identical think aloud studies, one in-person and one online with crowd-sourced participants. Based on our results, we discuss implications of crowd-sourced think-aloud studies.",

        "abstract": "Data visualizations are typically not accessible to blind and low-vision users. The most widely used remedy for making data visualizations accessible is text descriptions. Yet, manually creating useful text descriptions is often omitted by visualization authors, either because of a lack of awareness or a perceived burden. Automatically generated text descriptions are a potential partial remedy. However, with current methods it is unfeasible to create text descriptions for complex scientific charts. In this poster, we describe our methods for generating text descriptions for one complex scientific visualization: the UpSet plot. UpSet is a widely used technique for the visualization and analysis of sets and their intersections. At the same time, UpSet is arguably unfamiliar to novices and used mostly in scientific contexts. Generating text descriptions for UpSet plots is challenging because the patterns observed in UpSet plots have not been studied. We first analyze patterns present in dozens of published UpSet plots. We then introduce software that generates text descriptions for UpSet plots based on the patterns present in the chart. Finally, we introduce a web service that generates text descriptions based on a specification of an UpSet plot, and demonstrate its use in both an interactive web-based implementation and a static Python implementation of UpSet.",

The Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) mission uses space lidar to measure the 3D structure of global vegetation. The observations from GEDI, in the form of waveforms, hold the potential to reveal the spatial patterns and variation of ecosystem structures. However, it is difficult to understand this data due to its multivariate nature and random spatial sampling. Here, we use machine learning to develop a binning-based technique to visualize the spatial variation of large quantities of GEDI waveforms. This method can highlight the transition of different ecosystems through sharp changes in waveform distribution. In addition, it can reveal the internal heterogeneity of defined ecoregions. We expect this method to be helpful in studies of global ecosystems and generalize to other remote sensing data.",

Current Visual Analytics (VA) systems primarily support isolated aspects of this process, such as explaining binary AI alerts and visualizing transaction patterns, thus adding yet another layer of information to the overall complexity. In this work, we propose a framework where the VA system supports decision makers throughout all stages of financial fraud investigation, including data collection, information synthesis, and human criteria iteration.

        "abstract": "The need for innovative ideas in data visualisation drives us to explore new creative approaches. Combining two or more creative words, particularly those that contradict each other, can positively impact the creative process, sparking novel ideas and designs. As we move towards AI-driven design, an open question arises: do these design contradictions work positively with AI tools? Currently, the answer is no. AI systems, like large language models (LLMs), rely on algorithms that engender similarity, whereas creativity often requires divergence and novelty. This poster initiates a conversation on how to drive AI systems to be more creative and generate new ideas. This research invites us to reconsider traditional design methods and explore new approaches in an AI-driven world. Can we apply the same techniques used in traditional design, like the double diamond model, or do we need new methods for design engineering? How can we quickly design visualisations and craft new ideas with generative AI? This paper seeks to start this critical conversation and offers practical insights into the potential of AI in driving creativity in data visualisation.",

They serve as a real-world platform for students to display their work, bridging the gap between classroom learning and professional practice. Students must develop a technical solution, grasp the context, and produce work that is appropriate for public presentation. This scenario helps to encourage innovative thinking, engagement with the topic, and helps to enhance technical proficiency. We present our implementation of a data-art exhibition within a computing curriculum, for third-year degree-level students. Students create art-based visualisations from selected datasets and present their work in a public exhibition. We have used this initiative over the course of two academic years with different cohorts, and reflect on its impact on student learning and creativity.",

        "abstract": "As datasets increase in size and complexity, query latency and visualization rendering times can increase prohibitively. Analysts often pragmatically resort to performing exploratory analysis over a sampled subset of the data. However, a sampled subset may not accurately reflect key patterns, may miss important values, and may distort trends which are important for accurately completing common visual analytics tasks. Our work provides insights on the tradeoffs of various sampling methods. We conduct two experiments on five large-scale datasets using five sampling methods (two diverse, two probablistic, one visualization-based). The first experiment investigates the subjective ability of these five sampling methods to capture key features of the data. In our second experiment, we empirically measure user performance accuracy in common, low-level analytic tasks using visualizations sampled via the five methods. We evaluate the performance of these methods via three metrics: the accuracy of (1) human response at reading the sampled data values, (2) human perception in using samples to make inferences about the original data, and (3) human perception in using samples to correctly estimate the ground truth.",

While existing chart question-answering (CQA) systems can generate real-time text and visualizations based on data, they often fail to capture the contextual relationship between text and charts along with the lack of dynamic feedback mechanisms for iterative refinement to create tailored report. In this paper, we introduce and evaluate a prototype workflow for a CQA tool through the use of LLMs to query text and chart data, transform existing charts, and create new visualizations to support tailored report generation. CQA is designed to facilitate the interactive querying of the text and chart data within a document, chart transformation, and generation of new tailored report containing text and new visualizations that are directly derived from the original source documents. An initial testing indicated that, with the prototype, users can derive new visualizations and query for detailed insights and explanations.

In this paper, we explore the use of coordinated multiple views address these challenges. We describe SurpriseSync, which 1) directly visualizes surprise models and parameters using coordinated multiple views, 2) enables model tuning and encoding adjustment via direct manipulation and interaction with visualizations, and 3) supports the creation and comparison of linked surprise models at multiple scales.

This can pose a fundamental sense-making and communication challenge in contexts (like community organizing), where official data sources and local knowledge may have little overlap or even disagree. Second, indicating expectations, ambiguity, or contradiction between community and administrative data is likely to increase visualization complexity. This increased complexity poses challenges for accessibility and engagement. We outline our work to create a visual lexicon and address the interactions between these challenges.",

While a long line of research in the visualization community has sought to identify 'best design practices' to make visualizations more interpretable, the community has yet to articulate how the presence of specific design features contributes to whether a visualization is deemed overwhelming or overly complex. As an initial exploration into this gap, we augmented the MASSVIS dataset, one of the most comprehensive static visualization datasets to-date, with visual complexity ratings and also novel metadata capturing design features related to text, color, underlying data, and chart types. We examined distributions of visual design features across visualizations in the MASSVIS dataset and compared their effects on complexity. Intuitively, we find that higher quantities of visual elements are associated with higher ratings of complexity. Moreover, we determine that visualizations with certain designs (e.g., diagrams) are associated with higher ratings of complexity as opposed to visualizations without, while other design features are associated with lower ratings (e.g., captions).",

However, not every potentially important feature in the data may correspond to a visual feature which readers can detect, attend to, or value. In this work, we perform a mixed-methods study, where participants engage in a visual stenography task in which they re-draw line charts, to solicit information about the visual features that participants believe to be important in line charts and how faithfully and accurately they recreate them. We identified three predominant strategies, whose use correlated with the noise present in the stimuli: the replicators attempted to retain all major features of the line chart; the trend keepers faithfully retained trends but no other features; and the overwhelmed only represented the noise. Further, we found that participants tended to faithfully retain trends and peaks and valleys when these features were present, while periodicity and noise were represented in more qualitative or gestural ways: semantically rather than accurately. These results suggest a need to consider more flexible and human-centric ways of presenting, summarizing, pre-processing, or clustering time series data.",

CausalSynth enables users to define acyclic causal graphs via a user-friendly graphical interface, establish interrelationships between variables, and produce datasets that reflect these desired causal interactions. The application also includes built-in tools for visualizing the generated datasets, facilitating deeper insights into the user-defined causal structure and aiding the validation of the generated data.

Traditional methods, such as gaze trackers and mouse-based annotations, which generate continuous data, can be impractical in crowdsourcing scenarios. They require many participants, and the outcome data can be noisy. In contrast, our method first segments the graphical image with a grid and drops a portion of the patches (punch holes). Then, we iteratively ask the labeler to validate each annotation with holes, narrowing down the annotation only having the most important area. This approach aims to reduce annotation noise in crowdsourcing by standardizing the annotations while enhancing labeling efficiency and reliability. Preliminary findings from fundamental charts demonstrate that punch-hole labeling can effectively pinpoint critical regions. This also highlights its potential for broader application in visualization research, particularly in studying large-scale users\u201a\u00c4\u00f4 graphical perception. Our future work aims to enhance the algorithm to achieve faster labeling speed and prove its utility through large-scale experiments.",

        "abstract": "Investigating program optimizations requires navigation of the thousands of binary code lines and comparing them to their generating source code. Existing tools either focus on the understanding of assembly instructions order or the structure of the control flow. They usually focus on data from a single source file, which is insufficient to analyze large complex binaries. We have designed a new layout to balance the instruction order control flow of the binary code, visualize the loop structure, and handle large complex programs. This new layout is part of the tool DisViz, which correlates source code and assembly instructions. It is also designed for large and more complex multi-source binaries, making the navigation process easier. Our poster presents the system design and layout of DisViz and demonstrates its advantage for large-scale binary program analysis.",

While interviews with experts can help identify specific needs, they may not fully recognize more fundamental interest from broader but less expert communities. More importantly, targeted design studies have limited reach, typically only being deployed to a single target user group. We suggest that there is potential for broader impact in visualization research by reaching out to broader audiences, identifying gaps, and advocating for existing visualization research artifacts. In this work, we analyze publicly available data from machine learning tutorials and public software packages to understand how visualization is being used to explain and interpret machine learning concepts to beginners and learners. We present guidelines for visualization researchers to incorporate their research artifacts into tutorials and open source software packages to improve their impact.",

To understand whether results based on visual perception translate to tactile perception, we present a study replicating the formative study by Cleveland and McGill (1984) on graphical perception to tactile representations suitable for visually impaired users. To assess how tactile graphics can convey complex graphical information, we investigate the effectiveness of tactile data visualizations compared to reported results on visual graphical primitives, examining the accuracy and inference times of visually impaired versus sighted users. We find that visually impaired users interpret simpler tactile formats such as bar charts with significantly greater accuracy and speed than more complex formats like bubble charts.",

To do this, researchers can measure a visualization\u201a\u00c4\u00f4s visual complexity. However, the extent to which ratings of complexity vary depending on the design of a visualization has not yet been studied. We offer an initial exploration into this space by investigating how the chart types used in static visualizations are associated with variations in human ratings of visual complexity. We utilized the MASSVIS dataset of static visualizations, labeling each visualization by the chart types it contains and eliciting visual complexity ratings for each visualization. We find that the spread of visual complexity ratings for a given visualization looks different across chart types \u201a\u00c4\u00ec for example, Grid & Matrix, Line, and Bar charts were most represented in visualizations with less varied ratings, and Text and Circle charts were most represented in visualizations with more varied ratings. These findings suggest that some chart types may elicit a variety of reactions from different audiences when it comes to perceiving visual complexity while others may elicit more consistent perceptions.",

While there have been many studies of the design process in different contexts, the lower-level details of code-heavy visualization workflows have been harder to capture. Using exploratory notebooks and higher-level frameworks that facilitate rapid iteration, users can quickly test ideas and examine results. We use publicly-available notebook version histories to study how users work in these environments, observing both how they build new visualizations from existing templates or previous work, and how they refine and enhance visualizations over time. In addition, we study differences between the Observable Plot and Vega Lite visualization frameworks, and compare those code-oriented frameworks with the Observable Chart Cell wizard. Our analysis provides insights into how users build off of existing work including templates, and provides some clues about the use of different visualization properties and encodings, including those that may require more exploration.",

In this technique, a 3D Gaussian splatting model is built from a 3D point cloud generated using structure-from-motion, or a randomly initialized one when using a NeRF as input. This point cloud serves as the basis for initializing a set of Gaussian primitives, which are then refined through machine learning to minimize differences between ground truth and rendered images. We modified this pipeline to train Gaussian models directly from scientific data, eliminating the need for structure-from-motion. We test exporting an isosurface as a point cloud, which is then used to train a Gaussian model representing the dataset's isosurface. We also experimented with using a cinema database to produce a 3D Gaussian model; however, this approach yielded less promising results due to sub-optimal point cloud initialization. Our findings highlight the potential of this technique for scientific datasets, suggesting it could enable efficient post-hoc visualization with reduced computational resources.",

First, given a time step of the flow, methods from Topological Data Analysis (TDA) are leveraged to extract the geometry of the vortices. Specifically, the enstrophy of the flow is simplified by topological persistence, and the vortices are extracted by collecting the basins of the simplified enstrophy\u2019s Morse complex. Next, the local kinetic energy power spectrum is computed for each vortex. We introduce a set of indicators based on the kinetic energy power spectrum to estimate the correlation between the vortex\u2019s behavior and that of an idealized turbulent vortex. Our preliminary experiments show the relevance of these indicators for distinguishing vortices which are turbulent from those which have not yet reached a turbulent state and thus known as laminar.",

        "abstract": "The rise of heterogeneous resources in modern High Performance Computing (HPC) systems has propelled the scientific community beyond the exascale threshold. To maximize simulation performance on HPCs, applications increasingly rely on device resources, such as GPUs, leading to under-utilization of host resources, particularly CPUs. In situ analysis and visualization techniques minimize data movement by operating on data in-memory, but this still involves blocking operations that incur a small penalty on simulation performance. We explore a novel instrumentation approach where GPU-based timestep data is copied from device memory to host memory, enabling CPUs to concurrently perform visualization and analysis tasks. This strategy allows simulations to continue uninterrupted by an in situ library's analysis and visualization processes.",
