# Gather Guide

[Gather](https://gather.town/) is an 2D interactive online platform that allows conference attendees to meet and have audio/video conversations based on proximity. IEEE VIS 2021 has built a 2D New Orleans Town, where each building leads to additional conversation spaces. Additionally, we have placed Easter Eggs to give participants a New Orleans experience!

### What accessibility services are provided and how do I ask for help?

We acknowledge that Gather has accessibility limitations.  More information about this is provided on our main conference website: [ieeevis.org](http://ieeevis.org)

Student Volunteers will be on hand to provide assistance navigating the space. We suggest using the Gather **[Follow](https://support.gather.town/help/following#:~:text=To%20activate%20follow%20mode%2C%20click,to%20open%20the%20same%20module.)** feature. Student Volunteers will be available at the **Help Desk** and by request.

If you need assistance, please contact [accessibility@ieeevis.org](mailto:accessibility@ieeevis.org) or post the request in #support on Discord.  If you have already requested assistance via the registration system, someone will be in contact during the conference.


### Can I reserve space or get a direct link to a room for a gathering?

To make a reservation for a group or get a direct link to a GatherTown room for an event, please email: [viv@ieeevis.org](mailto:viv@ieeevis.org)


### Can I share the Gather link with others?

We only have a fixed number of logins allowed in our town. Please do not post the Gather link or password anywhere and please do not give it to others who are not attending the conference.


### I found a bug, who do I report it to?

Please contact [viv@ieeevis.org](mailto:viv@ieeevis.org) or post it to #support on Discord


### What do I need to use Gather?

You only need a desktop/laptop with a mic and camera, and a web browser (Chrome and Firefox recommended). Headphones are recommended. No need to download/install anything.


### How do I use Gather?

When you enter a Gather space for the first time, you are asked to define the appearance of your avatar, which you will use to move around the space. When you enter a name for your avatar, please enter your full name, so that the other participants can locate and contact you.

Gather provides a tutorial with details on how to set your avatar, move across rooms, interact with objects, follow, and chat with other people  [https://support.gather.town/help/movement-and-basics](https://support.gather.town/help/movement-and-basics)


### How do I get help with a technical problem with my audio or video?

Please use Gather support: [https://support.gather.town/help/av-troubleshooting](https://support.gather.town/help/av-troubleshooting)


### I keep getting lost, how can I find my way around?

Look for the little globe, ![Globe](https://ieeevis.b-cdn.net/vis_2021/help/gather/image5.png) as you get close, it will glow yellow ![Glowing Globe](https://ieeevis.b-cdn.net/vis_2021/help/gather/image2.png).

Press the “x” key to see the map full screen (this works for all interactive objects).  Press “x” again to make the map go away.


### Is there a faster way to get where I want to go?

We made a Teleportation room in the Help Desk building.  Simply go in the front door

and then walk to the place you want to go.

When you are in any of the rooms, look for the “Help Desk” sign and you can easily teleport back to the front steps of the Help Desk building.
