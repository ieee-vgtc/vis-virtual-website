Over the past decades, Visual Computing has become a key enabling technology for a diverse set of applications spanning scientific discovery, medicine, consumer electronics, and entertainment, to name just a few.

To solve problems in this vast space, the Visual Computing Center at KAUST draws from expertise in multiple disciplines, including Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, and Applied Mathematics, as well as a range of application domains. This interdisciplinary view allows for a pipeline approach including device development (e.g. computational cameras and displays), image and video understanding and semantic analysis, geometric modeling and understanding, simulation, and visualization. By considering this whole pipeline, more effective solutions can be found for problems in the mentioned application domains.
