In multi-objective optimization, conflicting objectives and constraints is a major area of concern. In such problems, several competing objectives are seen for which no single optimal solution is found that satisfies all desired objectives simultaneously. In the past, visual analytic (VA) systems have allowed users to interactively construct objective functions for a classifier. In this paper, we extend this line of work by prototyping a technique to visualize multi-objective objective functions either defined in a Jupyter notebook or defined using an interactive visual interface to help users to detect and resolve conflicting objectives. Visualization of the objective function enlightens potentially conflicting objectives that obstructs selecting correct solution(s) for the desired ML task or goal. We also present an enumeration of potential conflicts in objective specification in multi-objective objective functions for classifier selection. Furthermore, we demonstrate our approach in a VA system that helps users in specifying meaningful objective functions to a classifier by detecting and resolving conflicting objectives.",

Many causality techniques reason over a ``causal graph'' provided as input to the problem. When a causal graph cannot be produced from human expertise, ``causal discovery'' algorithms can be used to generate one from data. Unfortunately, causal discovery algorithms vary wildly in their results due to unrealistic data and modeling assumptions, so the results still need to be manually validated and adjusted. This paper presents a graph comparison tool designed to help analysts curate causal discovery results. This tool facilitates feedback loops whereby an analyst compares proposed graphs from multiple algorithms (or ensembles) and then uses insights from the comparison to refine parameters and inputs to the algorithms. We illustrate different types of comparisons and show how the interplay of causal discovery and graph comparison improves causal discovery.",

In this paper, we propose Lodestar, an interactive computational notebook that allows users to quickly explore and construct new data science workflows by selecting from a list of automated analysis recommendations. We derive our recommendations from directed graphs of known analysis states, with two input sources: one manually curated from online data science tutorials, and another extracted through semi-automatic analysis of a corpus of over 6,000 Jupyter notebooks. We evaluate Lodestar in a formative study guiding our next set of improvements to the tool. The evaluation suggests that users find Lodestar useful for rapidly creating data science workflows.",

While there exists a myriad of tools to support this task on tabular data, few tools exist to support analysts with more complex data types. In this study, we investigate how analysts process and transform large sets of XML data to create an analytic data model useful to further their analysis. We conduct a set of formative interviews with four experts that have diverse yet specialized knowledge of a common dataset. From these interviews, we derive a set of goals, tasks, and design requirements for transforming XML data into an analytic data model. We implement Natto as a proof-of-concept prototype that actualizes these design requirements into a set of visual and interaction design choices. We demonstrate the utility of the system through the presentation of analysis scenarios using real-world data. Our research contributes novel insights into the unique challenges of transforming data that is both hierarchical and internally linked. Further, it extends the knowledge of the visualization community in the areas of data preparation and wrangling.",

We utilize global and local views, hierarchical and flow-based graph layouts, multi-faceted search, neighborhood recommendations, and document visualizations to help researchers interactively explore, query, and analyze biological graphs against the backdrop of biomedical knowledge. The generality of our approach - insofar as it re-quires only knowledge graphs linked to documents - means it can support a range of therapeutic use cases across different domains, from disease propagation to drug discovery. Early interactions with domain experts support our approach for use cases with graphs with over 40,000 nodes and 350,000 edges.",

Patients suffering from IBD, e.g. Crohn\u2019s disease or ulcerative colitis, do not have a reduced life expectancy and disease progressions easily span several decades. We designed a visualization to highlight information that is vital for comparing patients and progressions, especially with respect to the treatments administered over the years. Medical experts can interactively determine the amount of information displayed and can synchronize the progressions to the beginning of certain treatments and medications. While the visualization was designed in close collaboration with IBD experts, we additionally evaluated our approach with 35 participants to ensure good usability and accessibility. The paper also highlights the future work on similarity definition and additional visual features in this on-going project.",

Due to limited display dimensions, conventional desktop-based applications have difficulties facilitating physicians converting 2D images to 3D intelligence. Recently, 3D printing of anatomical models has emerged as a technique to analyze CHD, but current workflows are tedious. To this end, we introduce and describe our ongoing work developing the Phoenix Virtual Heart (PVH), a hybrid VR-desktop software to aid in CHD surgical planning and family consultation. PVH is currently being integrated into a 3D printing workflow at a children's hospital as a way to increase physician efficiency and confidence, allowing physicians to analyze virtual anatomical models for surgical planning and family consultation.",

In the absence of an effective vaccine and as cases surge worldwide, governments were forced to adopt measures to inhibit the spread of the disease. To reduce its impact and to guide policy planning and resource allocation, researchers have been developing models to forecast the infectious disease. Ensemble models, by aggregating forecasts from multiple individual models, have been shown to be a useful forecasting method. However, these models can still provide less-than-adequate forecasts at higher spatial resolutions. In this paper, we built COVID-19 EnsembleVis, a web-based interactive visual interface that allows the assessment of the errors of ensembles and individual models by enabling users to effortlessly navigate through and compare the outputs of models considering their space and time dimensions.

The Ohio Children\u2019s Opportunity Index (OCOI) is a multi-dimensional area-level opportunity index comprised of eight health dimensions. Our research team has documented the design, development, and use cases of dashboard solutions to visualize OCOI. The OCOI is a multi-dimensional index spanning the following eight domains or dimensions: family stability, infant health, children\u2019s health, access, education, housing, environment, and criminal justice. Information on these eight domains is derived from the American Community Survey and other administrative datasets maintained by the state of Ohio. Our team used the Tableau Desktop visualization software and applied a user-centered design approach to developing the two OCOI dashboards\u2014 main OCOI dashboard and OCOI-race dashboard. We also performed convergence analysis to visualize the census tracts, where different health indicators simultaneously exist at their worst levels. The OCOI dashboards have multiple, interactive components: a choropleth map of Ohio displaying OCOI scores for a specific census tract, graphs presenting OCOI or domain scores to compare relative positions for tracts, and a sortable table to visualize scores for specific county and census tracts. Stakeholders provided iterative feedback on dashboard design in regard to functionality, content, and aesthetics. A case study using the two dashboards for convergence analysis revealed census tracts in neighborhoods with low infant health scores and a high proportion of minority population. The OCOI dashboards could assist end-users in making decisions that tailor health care delivery and policy decision-making regarding children\u2019s health particularly in areas where multiple health indicators exist at their worst levels.",

It uses a statistical model, most commonly Latent Dirichlet\nAllocation (LDA), to discover abstract topics that occur in the document collection. However, the LDA-based topic modeling procedure\nis based on a randomly selected initial configuration as well as a\nnumber of parameter values than need to be chosen. This induces\nuncertainties on the topic modeling results, and visualization methods should convey these uncertainties during the analysis process.\nWe propose a visual uncertainty-aware topic modeling analysis. We\ncapture the uncertainty by computing topic modeling ensembles and\npropose measures for estimating topic modeling uncertainty from\nthe ensemble. Then, we propose to enhance state-of-the-art topic\nmodeling visualization methods to convey the uncertainty in the\ntopic modeling process. We visualize the entire ensemble of topic\nmodeling results at different levels for topic and document analysis.\nWe apply our visualization methods to a text corpus to document the\nimpact of uncertainty on the analysis.",

This involved developing a\nnew visualization environment, known as the \u201dVirtual Rosetta\u201d for a\ncollection of early twentieth century Vietnamese drawings known as\nTechnique du Peuple Annamite (Mechanics and Crafts of the People\nof Annam) compiled by French colonial administrator Henri J. Oger\n(1872-1929). In this paper, we discuss similar work that has been\npursued by researchers in digital humanities, specifically working\nin virtual displays of artwork, the design of the Virtual Rosetta,\nincluding text readability, wall and text contrast, and organization\nof drawings, as well as the associated results. We used an analysis technique known as hierarchical clustering utilizing sentence\nembeddings, a technique in natural language processing in which\nsentences are mapped to numerical vectors, to organize a subset\nof the drawings so that drawings with similar text descriptions are\nlocated near each other. Performing this on an entire dataset would\nallow humanities researchers to most effectively and efficiently visualize their findings. We report on user experience and efficacy for a\nnumber of virtual environment layouts for displaying drawings and\nvisual information for research analysis in virtual reality.",

Our approach moves away from the subjective and often a-posteriori evaluations of user trust, towards more objective measures that are not only continuously tracked and updated, but also reflect both the confidence of the user in system suggestions, and the uncertainty of the system with regards to user goals. We argue that this approach is more suitable for guided visual analytics systems such as ours, where user strategies, goals and even trust can evolve over time, in reaction to new system feedback and insights from the exploration. Through the analysis of log data from a past user study with twelve participants performing a guided visual analysis task, we found that the stability of user exploration strategies is a promising factor to study \u201ctrust\u201d. However, indirect metrics based on provenance, such as user evaluation counts and disagreement rates, are alone not sufficient to study trust reliably in guided VAs. We conclude with open challenges and opportunities for exploiting analytic provenance to support trust monitoring in guided VA systems.",

To ensure fast and appropriate reactions to anomalies in device readings, this system communicates anomaly detection results and device readings to incorporate human expertise and experience. It exploits periodical behavior in the data combining spiral plots with results from anomaly detection. To support decisions, increase trust, and support cooperation in the system we enhanced it to be knowledge-assisted. A central knowledge base allows sharing knowledge between users and support during analysis. It consists of an ontology describing incidents, and a data base holding collections of exemplary sensor readings with annotations and visualization parameters. Related knowledge is proposed automatically and incorporated directly in the visualization to provide assistance that is closely coupled to the application, without additional hurdles. This integration is designed aiming on additional support for correct and fast detection of anomalies in the visualized device readings. We evaluate our enhancements to the Security in Process System in terms of effectiveness, efficiency, user satisfaction, and cognitive load with a detailed user study. Comparing the original and enhanced system, we are able to draw conclusions as to how our design narrows the knowledge gap between experts and laymen. Furthermore, we present and discuss the results and impact on our future research.",

This mantra implies human stakeholders, like a domain expert or data analyst, could leverage visual analytics techniques to seek answers to known unknowns and discover unknown unknowns in the course of the data sensemaking process. We argue that in the era of AI-driven automation, the roles of humans and machines (e.g., a machine learning model) need to be recalibrated in terms of a team. We posit that by realizing human-machine teams as a stakeholder unit, we can better achieve the best of both worlds: automation transparency and human reasoning efficacy. However, this also increases the burden on analysts and domain experts towards performing more cognitively demanding tasks than they are used to. In this paper, we reflect on the complementary roles in a human-machine team through the lens of cognitive psychology and map them to existing and emerging research in the visual analytics community. We discuss open questions around the nature of human agency and analyze the shared responsibilities in human-machine teams.",

However, it is not entirely clear to what extent and why this domain expertise impacts users' trust perceptions and evolutions. In addition, it remains challenging to accurately measure users' trust. We share our results and experiences of an exploratory case-study with a visual analytics system that incorporates a prediction model for time series. Through a mixed-methods approach involving Likert-type questionnaires and semi-structured interviews, we investigate users' trust evolutions and factors that affect their trust in the prediction model. Our results underline the multi-faceted nature of user trust, and suggest that domain expertise certainly affects trust, though it cannot fully foresee users' trust evolutions.",

Communicating the uncertainty associated with such forecasts is important, because it may affect users' trust in a forecasting model and, in turn, the decisions made based on the model. Although there exists a growing body of research on visualizing uncertainty in general, the important case of visualizing prediction uncertainty in time series forecasting has not been studied yet. Against this background, we investigated how different visualizations of predictive uncertainty affect the extent to which people follow predictions of a time series forecasting model. More specifically, we conducted an online experiment on forecasting occupied hospital beds due to the COVID-19 pandemic, measuring the influence of uncertainty visualization of algorithmic predictions on participants' own predictions. In contrast to prior studies, our empirical results suggest that more salient visualizations of uncertainty lead to decreased willingness to follow algorithmic forecasts.",

Still, the use in a clinical context of this technology is rather rare, mostly due to the missing trust of clinicians. In this position paper, we aim to show how uncertainty is introduced in the machine learning process when applying it to the medical do-main at multiple points and how this influences the decision-making process of clinicians in machine learning approaches. Based on this knowledge, we aim to refine the guidelines for trust in visual analytics to assist clinicians in using and understanding systems that are based on machine learning.",

It is arousing the interest of journalism professionals and scholars worldwide, including those in non-western societies. Limited studies have identified the challenges and opportunities of news visualization's adoption in non-western newsrooms, but the professionals' considerations and actions to deal with these challenges and seize the opportunities are unknown. This study explores the criteria for a valuable news visualization and how professionals balance the criteria and constraints to make news decisions in the newsrooms in China. A grounded analysis drawing on 15 in-depth interviews with professionals reveals the dynamics of source selection, interpretation, and presentation in news visualization production. It also shows that news visualization stories result from the debating and tradeoffs between the \"western norms\" and the organization's expectations, audiences' preferences, news commercialization, and macro environment in China.",

However, there is a lack of research on how to effectively return this information in a clear and comprehensible way to a wide audience. We conducted a national survey, testing various formats of health information visualizations, and found that overall comprehension is high across all formats, particularly among line graphs, with variations based on literacy and numeracy. This study reinforces the importance of testing various formats among target populations when returning key health information to patients.",

We provide design principles of paper maps and discuss design considerations based on exploratory design studies. We also conducted an initial evaluation for assessing the effectiveness of paper maps in summarizing scientific papers, suggesting that paper maps can improve the readability of scientific papers.",

Because aesthetics research in the field of visualization is relatively new, we survey aesthetics research in closely related fields, including psychology, graphic design, and marketing. Because of space limitations, we constrain our discussion of marketing research and omit any examination of related work from human-computer interaction researchers. We conclude with implications for communicative visualization practitioners and researchers, discussing the value of aesthetics and how to achieve it, as well as the need for research on longer-term aesthetic impacts on viewers.",

Providing greater visibility into students\u2019 online learning behavior has several potential benefits: 1) teachers who seek to provide live sessions that depend on knowledge from asynchronous resources will have a better gauge of students\u2019 preparation; 2) enhanced understanding of the relationship between student pacing and performance can help teachers and researchers characterize the impact of timely engagement with online course material; 3) providing a means of monitoring the effect of changes in course structure or incentives may guide course designers/planners in continuous improvement; and 4) visualizations that illustrate the relationship between students\u2019 course progress and performance have the promise of allowing teachers to take steps early to positively affect students\u2019 outcomes. In this visual case study, visualizations are provided for exploration of the relationship between student progress and performance in an online medicine-related course.",

In this panel we bring together four panelists who have experiences in both academia and industry to discuss various topics related to moving between the two sectors. Why does one move back and forth? In what ways are academia and industry similar or different? What are the differences between research labs and product teams in the industry? What affects one\u2019s movability from one place to another?\u00a0 The panelists include Hank Childs (University of Oregon), Miguel Encarna\u00e7\u00e3o (Regions Financial Corporation and University of Iowa), Melanie Tory (Northeastern University) and Jian Zhao (University of Waterloo).

How do we manage it all? Come explore and discuss this space with industry practitioners and experts that consume with these tools and build new tools on a daily basis. What limitations and trade-offs are there when selecting between different tools for different audiences? How can we promote stronger engagement between researchers and practitioners as we build these tools? What upcoming challenges will we face with the next generation of data vis tools? \n        \nThe panelists include: Zan Armstrong (Observable), Stephanie Kirmer (Saturn Cloud), Nicolas Kruchten (Plotly), and Krist Wongsuphasawat (Airbnb).",

In these assignments we explore three different approaches: conventional charts/graphs, non-conventional visualizations (modeled after Lupi and Posavec\u2019s \"Dear Data\"), and mapping. As you can imagine (and speaking to the central idea in your Call for Submissions), these activities looked markedly different during the pandemic. Projects from the past year \u2014 particularly the \u201cexperiential mapping\u201d projects \u2014 reflect how pandemic circumstances changed the frame and approach students took to observing and documenting their own daily lives and activities. In this lightning talk I would briefly share some examples of student submissions pre-pandemic, and then share three or four student submissions from this past year that I believe illuminate how the scales/scopes and/or approaches of projects reflected the pandemic. For some students, the pandemic radically limited their daily activities and travels \u2014 what had before often focused on national and even international travel now shrunk to micro-explorations like an annotated guide to the local Target store, or the travels of one quarantined student (to excruciating detail) travelling only within her dorm room and to-and-from the bathroom. The circumstances inspired nostalgia in others, focusing on memories of past travel destinations and the power of meaningful places to embed or trigger memories, such as childhood visits to the local theme park (memories of fighting with a sibling over which rides they would go on), or more distant memories of a random town where one student\u2019s family car broke down while on a long-ago cross-country family road trip. In an interesting coincidence, I would also share one student\u2019s pre-pandemic exploration of mapping the body and documenting sites of unwanted touch by acquaintances / strangers \u2014 particularly prescient now, after the shift from \u201cautomatic\u201d or even unconscious social niceties to hyper-vigilant avoidance.",

We created a three-week flow to teach middle and high school students the data fundamentals, analysis, and visualization. We used this activity flow in a three-week study with 12 middle and 12 high school students from an NGO. Our activity resources are available at https://github.com/karton-project/marti",

Given the rationale of this approach, we show which input was provided when necessary for the students to achieve their goals. We also discuss and compare the tools we found useful for students to accomplish their goals. Fitting project-based learning into the standard schedule of a semester at University is a particular challenge, because it is hard for students to devote longer periods of time when working on their projects. Furthermore, online learning was a challenge to effectively perform group activities and work. We address didactic considerations, our course structure, tools, and student projects. Finally, we draw conclusions on the results and improvements in the course structure.",

However, materials and activities aimed at educating children and young people about privacy and data protection mostly focus on children who are thirteen or older. As social media usage by children under the age of thirteen increases, there is a need to develop education curricula, materials and activities aimed at increasing children\u2019s data literacy and educating children about the challenges around privacy and data protection. We present DataBlokken, a life-size data physicalisation game that guides participants between the ages of nine and twelve through a series of challenges that gauge their understanding of data concepts and stimulates their sense of critical data literacy. By playing DataBlokken, participants learn that sharing personal data is unavoidable when navigating a social media application, personal data has value, and personal data ownership is possible. We tested and evaluated DataBlokken with 21 participants playing a total of six games. Preliminary findings indicate that participants enjoy playing the game, understand the rules of the game well and appreciate the size, tangible components and DIY-look and feel of the game. DataBlokken contributes to ongoing educational efforts around the topic of critical data literacy by demonstrating the didactic potential of data physicalisation games in stimulating children\u2019s sense of critical data literacy.",

For example, the dark-is-more bias leads observers to infer darker colors map to larger quantities. Previous studies on this bias tested visualizations representing ambiguous or novel domains to avoid effects of direct color-concept associations. Here, we investigated whether direct associations interact with the dark-is-more bias to influence expectations about the meanings of colors in colormaps. Participants saw colormaps representing fictitious data about amounts of shade or sunshine across geographical regions. Concept (shade/sunshine) varied between-subjects. All colormaps varied in lightness; one side was lighter and the other was darker. The task was to indicate which side had more shade/sunshine. In half the colormaps, the darker color was far more associated with shade, and less associated with sunshine, than the lighter color (high association difference). Thus, the dark-is-more bias and direct associations aligned for shade and conflicted for sunshine. In the other half, the light and dark colors were both weakly associated with shade and sunshine (low association difference). Thus, there was little alignment/conflict between direct associations and the dark-is-more bias. For colormaps with high association difference, participants inferred that darker colors mapped to more shade and lighter colors mapped to more sunshine, indicating that strong direct associations can override the dark-is-more bias. However, for colormaps with low association difference, participants inferred that darker colors mapped to larger amounts of both shade and sunshine, consistent with the dark-is-more bias. This latter result may be surprising, given that sunshine is inherently light. These results emphasize the importance of considering direct and relational associations to anticipate expectations about the meanings of colors in information visualizations.",

Recent work has shown that these visual representations of data can be biased, such that the position of a line in a chart will be consistently underestimated. But are the verbal representations of position encodings also biased in the same manner, or is this a purely visual bias that can be mitigated with verbal context? We explored the bias in position reproductions for simple uniform lines for both visual and verbal representations. We find that the direction of the bias changed depending on the response modality, with visual reproductions showing a position underestimation while verbal responses showed overestimation. This finding indicates that, even for simple line charts, biases are still present for both visual and verbal representations, although the directionality of this bias depends on the modality.",

In five other conditions, the ML outputs were presented to the users in different ways (bounding box, heat map, histogram, color coding, and text). In each visualization condition, the ML outputs could be correct (hits or correct rejections) or incorrect (misses or false alarms). When a target was present in the image and correctly identified by the ML output, participants responded faster and more accurately than they did in the baseline condition, regardless of how the output was visualized. Their speed and accuracy were best in the conditions in which the ML outputs were superimposed onto the image itself, rather than being presented adjacent to the image. However, when the superimposed ML outputs were incorrect, the participants performed significantly worse than they did in the baseline condition. Incorrect indicators that were adjacent to the image were less detrimental to the participants\u2019 performance.",

We also identify conditions where displays unequal in cumulative area, but different in numerosity, are perceived as being equal.

Current immersive displasys technology such as head-mounted displays (HMDs) and existing (and future) field of light (FoLD) 3D displays can present visual information with additional perceptual cues not found in existing 2D displays. We review immersive technology and existing studies which suggest that additional perceptual cues (e.g. stereoscopy and focal cues) from 3D displays can enhance visualization task performance. This suggests potential new studies which measure the effect of additional perceptual cues and their influence on effectiveness of visualization methods. It is our hypothesis that effective visualization techniques in the 2D setting may exhibit less optimal behavior when viewed on FoLDs and newer, more optimal methods will need to be developed and evaluated. We consider the problem of visualizing data which contains interesting structures across multiple scales. We hypothesize that the additional perceptual cues of FoLDs can enhance perception of shape structures across multiple scales and we suggest several possible approaches for studying this.",

Persuading people to adopt healthier behaviors, helping patients choose between courses of treatment with complex outcomes, deciding whether or not to sign up for a clinical trial; all of these scenarios involve accurately communicating probabilistic information about risk to laypeople. Even highly educated people have difficulty understanding probabilistic health information when communicated verbally. The solution has been to shift to graphic representations of probability. Unfortunately, the science of health graphics is atheoretical and largely ignores developments in basic vision science, leading to suboptimal outcomes and lack of replicability. Conversely, work on quantitative perception in vision science is rarely conducted in a health context. Visualization science has been primarily focused on serving physicians. It is time for a science of visual risk communication aimed at improving the visual communication of health risks and probabilities to patients and the public at large, across all educational and socioeconomic groups. This effort requires contributions from medicine, psychophysics, visualization, cognitive psychology, and affective science, among other disciplines.",

Many theories propose that we actively represent a memory representation of the friend in our visual working memory (VWM) and compare it with the individuals you see on the street. Although past studies have successfully characterized the capacity and quality of VWM, the consequence of its usage in perceptual comparisons has been largely unknown. In this talk, I will demonstrate that VWM representations get distorted when we use them for perceptual comparisons with new visual inputs, especially when the inputs are subjectively similar to the VWM representations. Furthermore, I will show that this similarity-induced memory bias (SIMB) occurs for both simple (e.g., color, shape) and complex stimuli (e.g., real-world objects, faces) that are perceptually encoded and retrieved from long-term memory. Given the observed versatility of the SIMB, its implication for other memory distortion phenomena (e.g., distractor-induced distortion, misinformation effect) will be discussed.",

                        "abstract": "Undirected graphs are frequently used to model phenomena that deal with interacting objects, such as social networks, brain activity and communication networks. The topology of an undirected graph G can be captured by an adjacency matrix; this matrix in turn can be visualized directly to give insight into the graph structure. Which visual patterns appear in such a matrix visualization crucially depends on the ordering of its rows and columns. Formally defining the quality of an ordering and then automatically computing a high-quality ordering are both challenging problems; however, effective heuristics exist and are used in practice.\n  \n  Often, graphs do not exist in isolation but as part of a collection of graphs on the same set of vertices, for example, brain scans over time or of different people. To visualize such graph collections, we need a single ordering that works well for all matrices simultaneously. The current state-of-the-art solves this problem by taking a (weighted) union over all graphs and applying existing heuristics. However, this union leads to a loss of information, specifically in those parts of the graphs which are different. We propose a collection-aware approach to avoid this loss of information and apply it to two popular heuristic methods: leaf order and barycenter.\n  \n  The de-facto standard computational quality metrics for matrix ordering capture only block-diagonal patterns (cliques). Instead, we propose to use Moran's I, a spatial auto-correlation metric, which captures the full range of established patterns. Moran's I refines previously proposed stress measures. Furthermore, the popular leaf order method heuristically optimizes a similar measure which further supports the use of Moran's I in this context. An ordering that maximizes Moran's I can be computed via solutions to the Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP); approximate orderings can be computed more efficiently, using any of the approximation algorithms for metric TSP.\n  \n  We evaluated our methods for simultaneous orderings on real-world datasets using Moran's I as the quality metric. Our results show that our collection-aware approach matches or improves performance compared to the union approach, depending on the similarity of the graphs in the collection. Specifically, our Moran's I-based collection-aware leaf order implementation consistently outperforms other implementations. Our collection-aware implementations carry no significant additional computational costs.",

In serial manufacturing processes, signatures from acoustic data provide valuable information on how the relationship between multiple produced engines serves to detect and understand previously unknown errors. To analyze such signatures, IRVINE leverages interactive clustering and data labeling techniques, allowing users to analyze clusters of engines with similar signatures, drill down to groups of engines, and select an engine of interest. Furthermore, IRVINE allows to assign labels to engines and clusters and annotate the cause of an error in the acoustic raw measurement of an engine. Since labels and annotations represent valuable knowledge, they are conserved in a knowledge database to be available for other stakeholders. We contribute a design study, where we developed IRVINE in four main iterations with engineers from a company in the automotive sector. To validate IRVINE, we conducted a field study with six domain experts. Our results suggest a high usability and usefulness of IRVINE as part of the improvement of a real-world manufacturing process. Specifically, with IRVINE domain experts were able to label and annotate produced electrical engines more than 30% faster.",

We introduce two frameworks: The first characterizes seven underlying mechanics that form the basis for a variety of visual superpowers portrayed in fiction. The second identifies seven ways in which visualization tools and interfaces can instill a sense of empowerment in the people who use them. Building on these observations, we illustrate a diverse set of \u201cvisualization superpowers\u201d and highlight opportunities for the visualization community to create new system sand interactions that empower new experiences with data",

Existing research in tensor field visualization focuses on 2D asymmetric tensor fields and 3D symmetric tensor fields. In this paper, we address the analysis and visualization of 3D asymmetric tensor fields. We introduce six topological surfaces and one topological curve, which lead to an eigenvalue space based on the tensor mode that we define. In addition, we identify several non-topological feature surfaces that are nonetheless physically important. Included in our analysis are the realizations that triple degenerate tensors are structurally stable and form curves, unlike the case for 3D symmetric tensors fields. Furthermore, there are two different ways of measuring the relative strengths of rotation and angular deformation in the tensor fields, unlike the case for 2D asymmetric tensor fields. We extract these feature surfaces using the A-patches algorithm. However, since three of our feature surfaces are quadratic, we develop a method to extract quadratic surfaces at any given accuracy. To facilitate the analysis of eigenvector fields, we visualize a hyperstreamline as a tree stem with the other two eigenvectors represented as thorns in the real domain or the dual-eigenvectors as leaves in the complex domain. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our analysis and visualization, we apply our approach to datasets from solid mechanics and fluid dynamics.",

Instead, research on visual attention suggests that the visual system iteratively applies a sequence of filtering operations on an image, extracting patterns from subsets of visual information over time, and selectively inhibiting other information at each of these moments. To demonstrate that this powerful series of filtering operations also occurs during the perception of visualized data, we designed a task where participants made judgments from one class of marks on a scatterplot, presumably incentivizing them to relatively ignore other classes of marks. Participants consistently missed a conspicuous dinosaur in the ignored collection of marks (93% for a 1s presentation, and 61% for 2.5s), but not in a control condition where the judgment task was removed (25% for a 1s presentation, and 11% for 2.5s), suggesting that data visualizations are not \"seen\" in a single glance, and instead require an active process of exploration.",

A cartogram is called contiguous if it conforms to this area principle while also keeping neighboring regions connected. Because of their distorted appearance, contiguous cartograms have been criticized as difficult to read. Some authors have suggested that cartograms may be more legible if they are accompanied by interactive features (e.g., animations, linked brushing, or infotips). We conducted an experiment to evaluate this claim. Participants had to perform visual analysis tasks with interactive and noninteractive contiguous cartograms. The task types covered various aspects of cartogram readability, ranging from elementary lookup tasks to synoptic tasks (i.e., tasks in which participants had to summarize high-level differences between two cartograms). Elementary tasks were carried out equally well with and without interactivity. Synoptic tasks, by contrast, were more difficult without interactive features. With access to interactivity, however, most participants answered even synoptic questions correctly. In a subsequent survey, participants rated the interactive features as \u201ceasy to use\u201d and \u201chelpful.\u201d Our study suggests that interactivity has the potential to make contiguous cartograms accessible even for those readers who are unfamiliar with interactive computer graphics or do not have a prior affinity to working with maps. Among the interactive features, animations had the strongest positive effect, so we recommend them as a minimum of interactivity when contiguous cartograms are displayed on a computer screen.",

To bridge the gap, we contribute Nebula, a grammar based on natural language for coordinating visualizations in MCVs. The grammar design is informed by a novel framework based on a systematic review of 176 coordinations from existing theories and applications, which describes coordination by demonstration, i.e., how coordination is performed by users. With the framework, Nebula specification formalizes coordination as a composition of user- and coordination-triggered interactions in origin and destination views, respectively, along with potential data transformation between the interactions. We evaluate Nebula by demonstrating its expressiveness with a gallery of diverse examples and analyzing its usability on cognitive dimensions.",

To investigate this hypothesis and to assess the effect the cut has on analysis performance, this paper presents results from a crowdsourced, controlled experiment with 72 participants comparing new continuous panning technique to linear bar charts (interactive wrapping). Our results show that bar charts with interactive wrapping lead to less errors compared to standard bar charts or polar charts. Inspired by these results, we generalise the concept of interactive wrapping to other visualisations for cyclical or relational data. We describe a design space based on the concept of one-dimensional wrapping and two-dimensional wrapping, linked to two common 3D topologies; cylinder and torus that can be used to metaphorically explain one- and two-dimensional wrapping. This design space suggests that interactive wrapping is widely applicable to many different data types.",

However, for more complex use cases\u2014e.g., remote database access and streaming data sources\u2014developers must grapple with distributed data and asynchronous events. Currently, constructing these use cases is difficult and time-consuming; developers are forced to operationally program low-level details like asynchronous database querying and reactive event handling. This approach is in stark contrast to modern methods for browser-based interactive visualization, which feature high-level declarative specifications. In response, we present DIEL, a declarative framework that supports asynchronous events over distributed data. Like many declarative visualization languages, DIEL developers need only specify what data they want, rather than procedural steps for how to assemble it; uniquely, DIEL models asynchronous events (e.g., user interactions or server responses) as streams of data that are captured in event logs. To specify the state of a user interface at any time, developers author declarative queries over the data and event logs; DIEL compiles and optimizes a corresponding dataflow graph, and synthesizes necessary low-level distributed systems details. We demonstrate DIEL\u2019s performance and expressivity through ex-ample interactive visualizations that make diverse use of remote data and coordination of asynchronous events. We further evaluate DIEL\u2019s usability using the Cognitive Dimensions of Notations framework, revealing wins such as ease of change, and compromises such as premature commitments.",

Users frequently need to undertake the time-consuming endeavour of opening a bundle within its visualization system to examine its many views and dashboards. In response, we contribute the first systematic approach to visualization snippet design. We propose a framework for snippet design that addresses eight key challenges that we identify. We present a computational pipeline to compress the visual and textual content of bundles into representative previews that is adaptive to a provided pixel budget and provides high information density with multiple images and carefully chosen keywords.

However, existing DR methods provide limited capability and flexibility for such comparative analysis as each method is designed only for a narrow analysis target, such as identifying factors that most differentiate groups. In this work, we introduce an interactive DR framework where we integrate our new DR method, called ULCA (unified linear comparative analysis), with an interactive visual interface. ULCA unifies two DR schemes, discriminant analysis and contrastive learning, to support various comparative analysis tasks. To provide flexibility for comparative analysis, we develop an optimization algorithm that enables analysts to interactively refine ULCA results. Additionally, we provide an interactive visualization interface to examine ULCA results with a rich set of analysis libraries. We evaluate ULCA and the optimization algorithm to show their efficiency as well as present multiple case studies using real-world datasets to demonstrate the usefulness of our framework.",

Recently, concept-based explanation has become a popular approach for post-hoc interpretation of DNNs. Instead of focusing on a single data sample to obtain local interpretation such as saliency maps, concept-based explanation provides a global interpretation of model predictions by analyzing how visual concepts affects model decision. For example, how the presence of shadow affects an object detection model. However, identifying human-friendly visual concepts that affect model decisions is a challenging task that can not be easily addressed with automatic approaches. In this paper, we present a novel human-in-the-loop visual analytics framework to generate user-defined concepts for model interpretation and diagnostics. The core of our approach is the use of active learning, where we integrate human knowledge and feedback to train a concept extractor in each stage. We crop or segment the original images into small image patches, extract the latent presentations from the hidden layer of the task model, select image patches sharing a common concept, and train a shallow net on top of the latent representation to collect image patches containing the visual concept. We combine these processes into an interactive system, ConceptExtract. Through two case studies, we show how our approach helps analyze model behavior and extract human-friendly concepts for different machine learning tasks and datasets and how to use these concepts to understand the predictions, compare model performance and make suggestions for model refinement. Quantitative experiments show that our active learning approach can accurately extract meaningful visual concepts. More importantly, by identifying visual concepts that negatively affect model performance, we develop the corresponding data augmentation strategy that consistently improves model performance.",

Achieving this usually needs experts to externalize their domain knowledge by manually specifying a class-attribute matrix to define which classes have which attributes. Designing a suitable class-attribute matrix is the key to the subsequent procedure, but this design process is tedious and trial-and-error with no guidance. This paper proposes a visual explainable active learning approach with its design and implementation called semantic navigator to solve the above problems. This approach promotes human-AI teaming with four actions (ask, explain, recommend, respond) in each interaction loop. The machine asks contrastive questions to guide humans in the thinking process of attributes. A novel visualization called semantic map explains the current status of the machine. Therefore analysts can better understand why the machine misclassifies objects. Moreover, the machine recommends the labels of classes for each attribute to ease the labeling burden. Finally, humans can steer the model by modifying the labels interactively, and the machine adjusts its recommendations. The visual explainable active learning approach improves humans' efficiency of building zero-shot classification models interactively, compared with the method without guidance. We justify our results with user studies using the standard benchmarks for zero-shot classification.",

We present NeuroCartography, an interactive system that scalably summarizes and visualizes concepts learned by neural networks. It automatically discovers and groups neurons that detect the same concepts, and describes how such neuron groups interact to form higher-level concepts and the subsequent predictions. NeuroCartography introduces two scalable summarization techniques: (1) neuron clustering groups neurons based on the semantic similarity of the concepts detected by neurons (e.g., neurons detecting \u201cdog faces\u201d of different breeds are grouped); and (2) neuron embedding encodes the associations between related concepts based on how often they co-occur (e.g., neurons detecting \u201cdog face\u201d and \u201cdog tail\u201d are placed closer in the embedding space). Key to our scalable techniques is the ability to efficiently compute all neuron pairs\u2019 relationships, in time linear to the number of neurons instead of quadratic time. NeuroCartography scales to large data, such as the ImageNet dataset with 1.2M images. The system\u2019s tightly coordinated views integrate the scalable techniques to visualize the concepts and their relationships, projecting the concept associations to a 2D space in Neuron Projection View, and summarizing neuron clusters and their relationships in Graph View. Through a large-scale human evaluation, we demonstrate that our technique discovers neuron groups that represent coherent, human-meaningful concepts. And through usage scenarios, we describe how our approaches enable interesting and surprising discoveries, such as concept cascades of related and isolated concepts. The NeuroCartography visualization runs in modern browsers and is open-sourced.",

Recurrent neural network (RNN) based DRL has demonstrated superior performance, as RNNs can effectively capture the temporal evolution of the environment and respond with proper agent actions. However, apart from the outstanding performance, little is known about how RNNs understand the environment internally and what has been memorized over time. Revealing these details is extremely important for deep learning experts to understand and improve DRLs, which in contrast, is also challenging due to the complicated data transformations inside these models. In this paper, we propose Deep Reinforcement Learning Interactive Visual Explorer (DRLIVE), a visual analytics system to effectively explore, interpret, and diagnose RNN-based DRLs. Focused on DRL agents trained for different Atari games, DRLIVE targets to accomplish three tasks: game episode exploration, RNN hidden/cell state examination, and interactive model perturbation. Using the system, one can flexibly explore a DRL agent through interactive visualizations, discover interpretable RNN cells by prioritizing RNN hidden/cell states with a set of metrics, and further diagnose the DRL model by interactively perturbing its inputs. Through concrete studies with multiple deep learning experts, we validated the efficacy of DRLIVE.",

Previous work has suggested such effects are limited to concepts that have strong, specific associations with colors. However, although a concept may not be strongly associated with any colors, its mapping can be disambiguated in the context of other concepts in an encoding system. We articulate this view in Semantic Discriminability Theory, a general framework for understanding conditions determining when people can infer meaning from perceptual features. Semantic discriminability is the degree to which observers can infer a unique mapping between visual features and concepts. Semantic Discriminability Theory posits that the capacity for semantic discriminability for a set of concepts is constrained by the difference between the feature-concept association distributions across the concepts in the set. We define formal properties of this theory, and test its implications in two experiments. The results show that the capacity to produce semantically discriminable colors for sets of concepts was indeed constrained by the statistical distance between color-concept association distributions (Experiment 1). Moreover, people could interpret meanings of colors in bar graphs insofar as the colors were semantically discriminable, even for concepts previously deemed \u201cnon-colorable\u201d (Experiment 2). The results suggest that colors are more robust for visual communication than previously thought.",

People also associate good and bad (emotional valence) with upward and downward locations, in line with metaphorical expressions such as \u2018uplifting\u2019 and \u2018down in the dumps\u2019. Graphs depicting good quantities (e.g., vacation days) are consistent with graphical convention and the valence metaphor, because \u2018more\u2019 of the good quantity is represented by higher y-axis positions. In contrast, graphs depicting bad quantities (e.g., murders) are consistent with graphical convention, but not the valence metaphor, because more of the bad quantity is represented by higher (rather than lower) y-axis positions. We conducted two experiments (N = 300 per experiment) where participants answered questions about line graphs depicting good and bad quantities. For some graphs, we inverted the conventional axis ordering of numbers. Line graphs that aligned (vs misaligned) with valence metaphors (up = good) were easier to interpret, but this beneficial effect did not outweigh the adverse effect of inverting the axis numbering. Line graphs depicting good (vs bad) quantities were easier to interpret, as were graphs that depicted quantity using the x-axis (vs y-axis). Our results suggest that conceptual metaphors matter for the interpretation of line graphs. However, designers of line graphs are warned against subverting graphical convention to align with conceptual metaphors.",

However, there is surprisingly little existing work that tests this assumption, especially given that visually computing ratios is relatively unimportant in real-world visualizations, compared to seeing, remembering, and comparing trends and motifs, across displays that almost universally depict more than two values. To simulate the information extracted from a glance at a visualization, we instead asked participants to immediately reproduce a set of values from memory after they were shown the visualization. These values could be shown in a bar graph (position (bar)), line graph (position (line)), heat map (luminance), bubble chart (area), misaligned bar graph (length), or \u2018wind map\u2019 (angle). \n  With a Bayesian multilevel modeling approach, we observed how the relevant rank positions of visual channels shift across different numbers of marks (2, 4 or 8) and for bias, precision, and error measures. The ranking did not hold, even for reproductions of only 2 marks, and the new ranking was highly inconsistent for reproductions of different numbers of marks. Other factors besides channel choice had an order of magnitude more influence on performance, such as the number of values in the series (e.g., more marks led to larger errors), or the value of each mark (e.g., small values were systematically overestimated). \n  Every visual channel was worse for displays with 8 marks than 4, consistent with established limits on visual memory.\n  These results point to the need for a body of empirical studies that move beyond two-value ratio judgments as a baseline for ranking the quality of a visual channel, including testing new tasks (detection of trends or motifs), timescales (immediate computation, or later comparison), and the number of values (from a handful, to thousands).",

We report both objective (pattern detection; area comparison) and subjective (affective quality; appropriateness; preference) measures of map-reader response. Our results suggest that affectively congruent colors amplify perceptions of the affective qualities of maps with emotive topics, affective incongruence may cause confusion, and that affective congruence is particularly influential in maps of positive-leaning data topics. Finally, we offer preliminary design recommendations for balancing color congruence with other design factors, and for synthesizing color and affective context in thematic map design.",

However, it is often difficult to visually differentiate graphical elements encoding a small difference in value, such as the heights of similar bars in bar chart or angles of similar sections in pie chart. Perceptual laws can be used in order to model when and how we perceive this difference. In this work, we model the perception of Just Noticeable Differences (JNDs), the minimum difference in visual attributes that allow faithfully comparing similar elements, in charts. Specifically, we explore the relation between JNDs and two major visual variables: the intensity of visual elements and the distance between them, and study it in three charts: bar chart, pie chart and bubble chart. Through an empirical study, we identify main effects on JND for distance in bar charts, intensity in pie charts, and both distance and intensity in bubble charts. By fitting a linear mixed effects model, we model JND and find that JND grows as the exponential function of variables. We highlight several usage scenarios that make use of the JND modeling in which elements below the fitted JND are detected and enhanced with secondary visual cues for better discrimination.",

The color-coded histograms enable users to see an overview of the whole data without cluttering or scalability issues. Each rectangle in the PHP histograms is color coded according to the data ranking by a selected attribute. This color-coding scheme allows users to visually examine relationships between attributes, even between those that are displayed far apart, without repositioning or reordering axes. We adopt the Visual Information Seeking Mantra so that the polylines of the original PCP can be used to show details of a small number of selected items when the cluttering problem subsides. We also design interactions, such as a focus+context technique, to help users investigate small regions of interest in a space-efficient manner. We provide a real-world example in which PHP is effectively utilized compared with other visualizations, and we perform a controlled user study to evaluate the performance of PHP in helping users estimate the correlation between attributes. The results demonstrate that the performance of PHP was consistent in the estimation of correlations between two attributes regardless of the distance between them.",

Monte Carlo (MC) path tracing is often used with surface models, yet its application for volumetric models is difficult due to the complexity of integrating MC light-paths in volumetric media with none or smooth material boundaries. Moreover, auxiliary geometry-buffers (G-buffers) produced for volumes are typically very noisy, failing to guide image denoisers relying on that information to preserve image details. This makes existing real-time denoisers, which take noise-free G-buffers as their input, less effective when denoising VPT images. We propose the necessary modifications to an image-based denoiser previously used when rendering surface models, and demonstrate effective denoising of VPT images. In particular, our denoising exploits temporal coherence between frames, without relying on noise-free G-buffers, which has been a common assumption of existing denoisers for surface-models. Our technique preserves high-frequency details through a weighted recursive least squares that handles heterogeneous noise for volumetric models. We show for various real data sets that our method improves the visual fidelity and temporal stability of VPT during classic DVR operations such as camera movements, modifications of the light sources, and editions to the volume transfer function.",

In this work, we make a first step towards answering the question of whether an artificial neural network can predict where to sample the data with higher or lower density, by learning of correspondences between the data, the sampling patterns and the generated images. We introduce a novel neural rendering pipeline, which is trained end-to-end to generate a sparse adaptive sampling structure from a given low-resolution input image, and reconstructs a high-resolution image from the sparse set of samples. For the first time, to the best of our knowledge, we demonstrate that the selection of structures that are relevant for the final visual representation can be jointly learned together with the reconstruction of this representation from these structures. Therefore, we introduce differentiable sampling and reconstruction stages, which can leverage back-propagation based on supervised losses solely on the final image. We shed light on the adaptive sampling patterns generated by the network pipeline and analyze its use for volume visualization including isosurface and direct volume rendering.",

STNet includes two modules: a generator and a spatiotemporal discriminator. The input to the generator is two low-resolution volumes at both ends, and the output is the intermediate and the two-ending spatiotemporal super- resolution volumes. The spatiotemporal discriminator, leveraging convolutional long short-term memory, accepts a spatiotemporal super-resolution sequence as input and predicts a conditional score for each volume based on its spatial (the volume itself) and temporal (the previous volumes) information. We propose an unsupervised pre-training stage using cycle loss to improve the generalization of STNet. Once trained, STNet can generate spatiotemporal super-resolution volumes from low-resolution ones, offering scientists an option to save data storage (i.e., sparsely sampling the simulation output in both spatial and temporal dimensions). We compare STNet with the baseline bicubic+linear interpolation, two deep learning solutions (SSR+TSR, STD), and a state-of-the-art tensor compression solution (TTHRESH) to show the effectiveness of STNet.",

However, objectivity by itself, although crucial, is not sufficient to guarantee that one can identify physically-realizable observers that would perceive or detect the same vortices. Moreover, a significant challenge is that a single reference frame is often not sufficient to accurately observe multiple vortices that follow different motions. This paper presents a novel framework for the exploration and use of an interactively-chosen set of observers, of the resulting relative velocity fields, and of objective vortex structures. We show that our approach facilitates the objective detection and visualization of vortices relative to well-adapted reference frame motions, while at the same time guaranteeing that these observers are in fact physically realizable. In order to represent and manipulate observers efficiently, we make use of the low-dimensional vector space structure of the Lie algebra of physically-realizable observer motions. We illustrate that our framework facilitates the efficient choice and guided exploration of objective vortices in unsteady 2D flow, on planar as well as on spherical domains, using well-adapted reference frames.",

To assess the representativeness of the selected multi-parameter distribution across the ensemble, we propose a novel extension of violin plots that can show multiple parameter distributions simultaneously. We investigate the visual design that effectively conveys (dis-)similarities in multi-parameter distributions, and demonstrate that users can quickly comprehend parameter-specific differences regarding distribution shape and representativeness from a side-by-side view of these plots. In a 3D spatial view, users can analyse and compare the spatial distribution of selected data points in different ensemble members via interval-based isosurface raycasting.

With the growing availability of large-scale well-documented academic profiles and career trajectories, scholarly interest in career success has been reinvigorated, which has emerged to be an active research domain called the Science of Science (i.e., SciSci). In this study, we adopt an innovative dynamic perspective to examine how individual and social factors will influence career success over time. We propose ACSeeker, an interactive visual analytics approach to explore the potential factors of success and how the influence of multiple factors changes at different stages of academic careers. We first applied a Multi-factor Impact Analysis framework to estimate the effect of different factors on academic career success over time. We then developed a visual analytics system to understand the dynamic effects interactively. A novel timeline is designed to reveal and compare the factor impacts based on the whole population. A customized career line showing the individual career development is provided to allow a detailed inspection. To validate the effectiveness and usability of ACSeeker, we report two case studies and interviews with a social scientist and general researchers.",

These approaches serve a critical purpose for academic literature reviews, yet there remain challenges in identifying relevant literature when similar work may utilize different terminology (e.g., mixed-initiative visual analytics papers may not use the same terminology as papers on model-steering, yet the two topics are relevant to one another). In this paper, we introduce a system, VITALITY, intended to complement existing practices. In particular, VITALITY promotes serendipitous discovery of relevant literature using transformer language models, allowing users to find semantically similar papers in a word embedding space given (1) a list of input paper(s) or (2) a working abstract. VITALITY visualizes this document-level embedding space in an interactive 2-D scatterplot using dimension reduction. VITALITY also summarizes meta information about the document corpus or search query, including keywords and co authors, and allows users to save and export papers for use in a literature review. We present qualitative findings from an evaluation of VITALITY, suggesting it can be a promising complementary technique for conducting academic literature reviews. Furthermore, we contribute data from 38 popular data visualization publication venues in VITALITY, and we provide scrapers for the open-source community to continue to grow the list of supported venues.",

We look in particular at the gender of VIS authors as a proxy for the community at large. We consider measures of overall gender representation among authors, differences in careers, positions in author lists, and collaborations. We found that the proportion of female authors has increased from 9% in the first five years to 22% in the last five years of the conference. Over the years, we found the same representation of women in program committees and slightly more women in organizing committees. Women are less likely to appear in the last author position, but more in the middle positions. In terms of collaboration patterns, female authors tend to collaborate more than expected with other women in the community.

Moreover, there is a lack of quantitative analysis methods to help understand effective speaking strategies. In this paper, we propose E-ffective, a visual analytic system allowing speaking experts and novices to analyze both the role of speech factors and their contribution in effective speeches. From interviews with domain experts and investigating existing literature, we figured out important factors to consider in inspirational speeches. We obtained the generated factors from multi-modal data that were then related to effectiveness data. Our system supports rapid understanding of critical factors in inspirational speeches, including the influence of emotions by means of novel visualization methods and interaction. Two novel visualizations include E-spiral (that shows the emotional shifts in speeches in a visually compact way) and E-script (that connects speech content with key speech delivery information). In our evaluation we studied the influence of our system on experts' domain knowledge about speech factors. We further studied the usability of the system by speaking novices and experts on assisting analysis of inspirational speech effectiveness.",

It includes redress and complaints on decisions of a child\u2019s education, social care, licensing, planning, environment, housing and homelessness. However, if someone has a complaint or an issue, it is challenging for people to understand different possible redress paths and explore what path is suitable for their situation. Explanatory visualisation has the potential to display these paths of redress in a clear way, such that people can see, understand and explore their options. The visualisation challenge is further complicated because information is spread across many documents, laws, guidance and policies and requires judicial interpretation. Consequently, there is not a single database of paths of redress. In this work we present how we have co-designed a system to visualise administrative justice paths of redress. Simultaneously, we classify, collate and organise the underpinning data, from expert workshops, heuristic evaluation and expert critical reflection. We make four contributions: (i) an application design study of the explanatory visualisation tool (Artemus), (ii) coordinated and co-design approach to aggregating the data, (iii) two in-depth case studies in housing and education demonstrating explanatory paths of redress in administrative law, and (iv) reflections on the expert co-design process and expert data gathering and explanatory visualisation for administrative justice and law.",

Decision makers rely on data analysis, which is either delegated to analysts, or done on their own. Often the decision maker combines data, likely uncertain or incomplete, with non-formalized knowledge within a multi-objective problem space, weighing the recommendations of analysts within broader contexts and goals. As most past research in visual analytics has focused on understanding the needs and challenges of data analysts, less is known about the tasks and challenges of organizational decision makers, and how visualization support tools might help. Here we characterize the decision maker as a domain expert, review relevant literature in management theories, and report the results of an empirical survey and interviews with people who make organizational decisions. We identify challenges and opportunities for novel visualization tools, including trade-off overviews, scenario-based analysis, interrogation tools, flexible data input and collaboration support. Our findings stress the need to expand visualization design beyond data analysis into tools for information management.",

Hence, it is increasingly important to support users with an integrated knowledge base in making constructive choices and drawing the right conclusions. We support the effective reactivation of visualization software resources by augmenting them with knowledge-assistance. To provide a general and yet supportive implementation strategy, we propose an implementation process that bases on an application-agnostic architecture. This architecture is derived from existing knowledge-assisted visualization systems and the KAVA model. Its centerpiece is an ontology that is able to automatically analyze and classify input data, linked to a database to store classified instances. We discuss design decisions and advantages of the KR framework and illustrate its broad area of application in diverse integration possibilities of this architecture into an existing visualization system. In addition, we provide a detailed case study by augmenting an it-security system with knowledge-assistance facilities.",

Our analysis suggests that decision tasks are not commonly found in current visualization task taxonomies and that the visualization field has yet to leverage guidance from decision theory domains on how to study such tasks. We further found that the majority of visualizations addressing decision making were not evaluated based on their ability to assist decision tasks. Finally, to help expand the impact of visual analytics in organizational as well as casual decision making activities, we initiate a research agenda on how decision making assistance could be elevated throughout visualization research.",

We conducted two qualitative interview studies with individuals who prepare and deliver presentations about data to audiences in organizations. In contrast to prior work, we did not limit our interviews to those who self-identify as data analysts or data scientists. Both studies examined aspects of speaking about data with visual aids such as charts, dashboards, and tables. One study was a retrospective examination of current practices and difficulties, from which we identified three scenarios involving presentations of data. We describe these scenarios using an analogy to musical performance: small collaborative team meetings are akin to jam session, while more structured presentations can range from semi-improvisational performances among peers to formal recitals given to executives or customers. In our second study, we grounded the discussion around three design probes, each examining a different aspect of presenting data: the progressive reveal of visualization to direct attention and advance a narrative, visualization presentation controls that are hidden from the audience\u2019s view, and the coordination of a presenter\u2019s video with interactive visualization. Our distillation of interviewees\u2019 responses surfaced twelve themes, from ways of authoring presentations to creating accessible and engaging audience experiences.",

We formally evaluate the quality of causal inferences from visualizations by adopting causal support---a Bayesian cognition model that learns the probability of alternative causal explanations given some data---as a normative benchmark for causal inferences. We contribute two experiments assessing how well crowdworkers can detect (1) a treatment effect and (2) a confounding relationship. We find that chart users\u2019 causal inferences tend to be insensitive to sample size such that they deviate from our normative benchmark. While interactively cross-filtering data in visualizations can improve sensitivity, on average users do not perform reliably better with common visualizations than they do with textual contingency tables. These experiments demonstrate the utility of causal support as an evaluation framework for inferences in VA and point to opportunities to make analysts' mental models more explicit in VA software.",

In many cases, domain experts --- who often have no expertise in ML or data science --- are asked to use ML predictions to make high-stakes decisions. Multiple ML usability challenges can appear as result, such as lack of user trust in the model, inability to reconcile human-ML disagreement, and ethical concerns about oversimplification of complex problems to a single algorithm output. In this paper, we investigate the ML usability challenges that present in the domain of child welfare screening through a series of collaborations with child welfare screeners. Following the iterative design process between the ML scientists, visualization researchers, and domain experts (child screeners), we first identified four key ML challenges and honed in on one promising explainable ML technique to address them (local factor contributions). Then we designed, implemented, and evaluated our visual analytics tool, Sibyl, to increase the interpretability and interactivity of local factor contributions. The effectiveness of our tool is demonstrated by two formal user studies with 12 non-expert participants and 13 expert participants respectively. Valuable feedback is collected, from which we also composed a list of design implications as a useful guideline for researchers that aim to develop an interpretable and interactive visualization tool for ML prediction models deployed for child welfare screeners and other similar domain experts.",

A common example are dashboards, which are frequently used in domains such as finance, process monitoring and business intelligence. However, users may not be aware of existing guidelines and lack expert design knowledge when composing such multi-view visualizations. In this paper, we present semantic snapping, an approach to help non-expert users design effective multi-view visualizations from sets of pre-existing views. When a particular view is placed on a canvas, it is \"aligned'' with the remaining views--not with respect to its geometric layout, but based on aspects of the visual encoding itself, such as how data dimensions are mapped to channels. Our method uses an on-the-fly procedure to detect and suggest resolutions for conflicting, misleading, or ambiguous designs, as well as to provide suggestions for alternative presentations. With this approach, users can be guided to avoid common pitfalls encountered when composing visualizations. Our provided examples and case studies demonstrate the usefulness and validity of our approach.",

One common task of visual analysis with multiple views is to relate data across different views. For example, to identify threats, an intelligence analyst needs to link people from a social network graph with locations on a crime-map, and then search and read relevant documents. Currently, exploring cross-view data relationships heavily relies on view-coordination techniques (e.g., brushing and linking). They may require significant user effort on many trial-and-error attempts, such as repetitiously selecting elements in one view, observing and following elements highlighted in other views. To address this, we present SightBi, a visual analytics approach for supporting cross-view data relationship explorations. We discuss the design rationale of SightBi in detail, with identified user tasks regarding the usage of cross-view data relationships. SightBi formalize cross-view data relationships as biclusters and compute them from a dataset. SightBi uses a bi-context design that highlights creating stand-alone relationship-views. This helps to preserve existing views and serves as an overview of cross-view data relationships to guide user explorations. Moreover, SightBi allows users to interactively manage the layout of multiple views by using newly created relationship-views. With a usage scenario, we demonstrate the usefulness of SightBi for sensemaking of cross-view data relationships.",

Experts have attempted to replace liquid electrolytes with solid electrolytes that have wider electrochemical window and higher stability due to the potential safety risks, such as electrolyte leakage, flammable solvents, poor thermal stability, and many side reactions caused by liquid electrolytes. However, finding suitable alternative materials using traditional approaches is very difficult due to the incredibly high cost in searching. Machine learning (ML)-based methods are currently introduced and used for material prediction. However, learning tools designed for domain experts to conduct intuitive performance comparison and analysis of ML models are rare. In this case, we propose an interactive visualization system for experts to select suitable ML models and understand and explore the predication results comprehensively. Our system uses a multifaceted visualization scheme designed to support analysis from various perspectives, such as feature distribution, data similarity, model performance, and result presentation. Case studies with actual lab experiments have been conducted by the experts, and the final results confirmed the effectiveness and helpfulness of our system.",

In particular, through the analysis of photometric and polarimetric observations of blazars, astronomers aim to understand the physics of the blazar's relativistic jet. However, it is challenging to recognize correlations and time variations of the observed polarization, intensity, and color of the emitted light. In our prior study, we proposed TimeTubes to visualize a blazar dataset as a 3D volumetric tube. In this paper, we build primarily on the TimeTubes representation of blazar datasets to present a new visual analytics environment named TimeTubesX, into which we have integrated sophisticated feature and pattern detection techniques for effective location of observable and recurring time variation patterns in long-term, multi-dimensional datasets. Automatic feature extraction detects time intervals corresponding to well-known blazar behaviors. Dynamic visual querying allows users to search long-term observations for time intervals similar to a time interval of interest (query-by-example) or a sketch of temporal patterns (query-by-sketch). Users are also allowed to build up another visual query guided by the time interval of interest found in the previous process and refine the results. We demonstrate how TimeTubesX has been used successfully by domain experts for the detailed analysis of blazar datasets and report on the results.",

The \u201ceffective surface area,\u201d the surface area accessible to the airflow, is typically measured using a permeametry apparatus that relates the flow conductance to the permeable surface area via the Carman-Kozeny equation. This equation allows calculating the flow rate of a fluid flowing through the granules packed in the sample for a given pressure drop. However, Carman-Kozeny makes inherent assumptions about tunnel shapes and flow paths that may not accurately hold in situations where the particles possess a wide distribution in shapes, sizes, and aspect ratios, as is true with many powdered systems of technological and commercial interest. To address this challenge, we replicate these measurements virtually on micro-CT images of the powdered material, introducing a new Pore Network Model (PNM) based on the skeleton of the Morse-Smale complex. Pores are identified as basins of the complex, their incidence encodes adjacency, and the conductivity of the capillary between them computed from the cross-section at their interface. We build and solve a resistive network to compute an approximate laminar fluid flow through the pore structure. We provide two means of estimating flow-permeable surface area: (i) by direct computation of conductivity, and (ii) by identifying dead-ends in the flow coupled with isosurface extraction and the application of the Carman-Kozeny equation, with the aim of establishing consistency over a range of particle shapes, sizes, porosity levels, and void distribution patterns.",

Given a molecular trajectory, SDFs can, for example, reveal the occurrence of water in relation to particular structures and hence provide clues of hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions. For the computation of meaningful distribution functions, the definition of molecular reference structures is essential. Therefore we introduce the concept of an internal frame of reference (IFR) for labeled point sets that represent selected molecular structures, and we propose an algorithm for tracking the IFR over time and space using a variant of Kabsch\u2019s algorithm. This approach lets us generate a consistent space for the aggregation of the SDF for molecular trajectories and molecular ensembles. We demonstrate the usefulness of the technique by applying it to temporal molecular trajectories as well as ensemble datasets. The examples include different docking scenarios with DNA, insulin, and aspirin.",

These recommendations are typically organized into categories based on their analytical actions, i.e., operations employed to transition from the current exploration state to a recommended visualization. However, despite the emergence of a plethora of VisRec systems in recent work, the utility of the categories employed by these systems in analytical workflows has not been systematically investigated. Our paper explores the efficacy of recommendation categories by formalizing a taxonomy of common categories and developing a system, Frontier, that implements these categories. Using Frontier, we evaluate workflow strategies adopted by users and how categories influence those strategies. Participants found recommendations that add attributes to enhance the current visualization and recommendations that filter to sub-populations to be comparatively most useful during data exploration. Our findings pave the way for next-generation VisRec systems that are adaptive and personalized via carefully chosen, effective recommendation categories.",

However, existing rule-based approaches require tedious manual specifications of visualization rules by visualization experts. Other machine learning-based approaches often work like black-box and are difficult to understand why a specific visualization is recommended, limiting the wider adoption of these approaches. This paper fills the gap by presenting KG4Vis, a knowledge graph (KG)-based approach for visualization recommendation. It does not require manual specifications of visualization rules and can also guarantee good explainability. Specifically, we propose a framework for building knowledge graphs, consisting of three types of entities (i.e., data features, data columns and visualization design choices) and the relations between them, to model the mapping rules between data and effective visualizations. A TransE-based embedding technique is employed to learn the embeddings of both entities and relations of the knowledge graph from existing dataset-visualization pairs. Such embeddings intrinsically model the desirable visualization rules. Then, given a new dataset, effective visualizations can be inferred from the knowledge graph with semantically meaningful rules. We conducted extensive evaluations to assess the proposed approach, including quantitative comparisons, case studies and expert interviews. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.",

Therefore, additional specification adjustments are still required in real-world use cases. However, manual adjustments are difficult since most users do not necessarily possess adequate skills or visualization knowledge. Even experienced users might create imperfect visualizations that involve chart construction errors. We present a framework, VizFixer, to help users detect flaws and rectify already-built but defective visualizations. The framework consists of two components, (1) a visualization linter, which applies well-recognized principles to inspect the legitimacy of rendered visualizations, and (2) a visualization fixer, which automatically corrects the detected violations according to the linter. We implement the framework into an online editor prototype based on Vega-Lite specifications. To further evaluate the system, we conduct an in-lab user study. The results prove its effectiveness and efficiency in identifying and fixing errors for data visualizations.",

Operationally, we separate the tasks of data management, visual designs, and plots and dashboard deployment in order to streamline the development workflow. Technically, we utilize: an ontology to bring datasets, visual designs, and deployable plots and dashboards under the same management framework; multi-criteria search and ranking algorithms for discovering potential datasets that match a visual design; and a purposely-design user interface for propagating each visual design to appropriate datasets (often in tens and hundreds) and quality-assuring the propagation before the deployment.

This paper contributes a review of personal informatics and visualization research literature to expose a gap in our knowledge for designing flexible tools that assist people with engaging and analyzing personal data in personal contexts, which we call the personal informatics analysis gap. We explore this gap through a multi-stage longitudinal study on how asthmatics engage personal air quality data, and we report how participants: are motivated by broad and diverse goals; exhibited patterns in the way they explored their data; engaged with their data in playful ways; discovered new insights through serendipitous exploration; and were reluctant to use analysis tools on their own. These results present new opportunities for visual analysis research and suggest the need for fundamental shifts in how and what we design for supporting analysis of personal data.",

The concept has gained interest from multiple research communities, including information visualization, human-computer interaction and augmented reality. This has led to a range of explorations and applications of the concept, however, this early work has focused on the operational aspect of situatedness leading to inconsistent adoption of the concept and terminology. \n  First, we contribute a literature survey in which we analyze 40 papers that explicitly use the term \"situated visualization\" to provide an overview of the research area, how it defines situated visualization, common application areas and technology used, as well as type of data and type of visualizations. Our survey shows that research on situated visualization has focused on technology-centric approaches that forefront a spatial understanding of situatedness. \n  Secondly, we contribute five perspectives on situatedness (space, time, place, activity, and community) that expand on the prevalent notion of situatedness in the corpus. We draw from six case studies and prior theoretical developments in HCI. Each perspective develops a generative way of looking at and working with situatedness in design and research. We outline future directions, including considering technology, material and aesthetics, leveraging the perspectives for design, and methods for stronger engagement with target audiences. We conclude with opportunities to consolidate situated visualization research.",

The tactic in badminton is defined as a sequence of consecutive strokes. Most existing methods use statistical models to find sequential patterns of strokes and apply 2D visualizations such as glyphs and statistical charts to explore and analyze the discovered patterns. However, in badminton, spatial information like the shuttle trajectory, which is inherently 3D, is the core of a tactic. The lack of sufficient spatial awareness in 2D visualizations largely limited the tactic analysis of badminton. In this work, we collaborate with domain experts to study the tactic analysis of badminton in a 3D environment and propose an immersive visual analytics system, TIVEE, to assist users in exploring and explaining badminton tactics from multi-levels. Users can first explore various tactics from the third-person perspective using an unfolded visual presentation of stroke sequences. By selecting a tactic of interest, users can turn to the first-person perspective to perceive the detailed kinematic characteristics and explain its effects on the game result. The effectiveness and usefulness of TIVEE are demonstrated by case studies and an expert interview.",

However, transformations can alter relationships or patterns implied by the large screen view, requiring authors to reason carefully about what information to preserve while adjusting their design for the smaller display. We propose an automated approach to approximating the loss of support for task-oriented visualization insights (identification, comparison, and trend) in responsive transformation of a source visualization. We operationalize identification, comparison, and trend loss as objective functions calculated by comparing properties of the rendered source visualization to each realized target (small screen) visualization. To evaluate the utility of our approach, we train machine learning models on human ranked small screen alternative visualizations across a set of source visualizations. We find that our approach achieves an accuracy of 84% (random forest model) in ranking visualizations. We demonstrate this approach in a prototype responsive visualization recommender that enumerates responsive transformations using Answer Set Programming and evaluates the preservation of task-oriented insights using our loss measures. We discuss implications of our approach for the development of automated and semi-automated responsive visualization recommendation.",

We hypothesize that perceiving approximately monotonic trends across multiple attributes is key to the overall interpretability of sorted results, because users can easily predict the attribute values of the next items. We extend a ranking principal curve model to tune monotonic trends in attributes and present Imma Sort to sort items by multiple attributes simultaneously by trading-off the monotonicity in the primary sorted attribute to increase the human predictability for other attributes. We characterize how it performs for varying attribute correlations, attribute preferences, list lengths and number of attributes. We further extend Imma Sort with ImmaAnchor and ImmaCenter to improve the learnability and efficiency to search sorted items with conflicting attributes. We demonstrate usage scenarios for two applications and evaluate its learnability, usability, interpretability and user performance in prediction and search tasks. We find that Imma Sort improves the interpretability and satisfaction of sorting by \u2265 2 attributes. We discuss why, when, where, and how to deploy Imma Sort for real-world applications.",

In this work, we extend the Dual Analysis framework through the joint treatment of quantitative (numerical) and qualitative (categorical) dimensions. Computing common measures for all dimensions allows us to visualize both quantitative and qualitative dimensions in the same view. This enables a natural joint treatment of mixed data during interactive visual exploration and analysis. Several measures of variation for nominal qualitative data can also be applied to ordinal qualitative and quantitative data. For example, instead of measuring variability from a mean or median, other measures assess inter-data variation or average variation from a mode. In this work, we demonstrate how these measures can be integrated into the Dual Analysis framework to explore and generate hypotheses about high-dimensional mixed data. A medical case study using clinical routine data of patients suffering from Cerebral Small Vessel Disease (CSVD), conducted with a senior neurologist and a medical student, shows that a joint Dual Analysis approach for quantitative and qualitative data can rapidly lead to new insights based on which new hypotheses may be generated.",

However, different DR techniques would yield various patterns, which significantly affect the performance of visual cluster analysis tasks. We present the results of a user study that investigates the influence of different DR techniques on visual cluster analysis. Our study focuses on the most concerned property types, namely the linearity and locality, and evaluates twelve representative DR techniques that cover the concerned properties. Four controlled experiments were conducted to evaluate how the DR techniques facilitate the tasks of 1) identifying clusters, 2) associating cluster members, 3) comparing distances among clusters, and 4) comparing cluster densities, respectively. We also evaluated users\u2019 subjective preference of the DR techniques regarding the quality of projected clusters. The results show that: 1) Non-linear and Local techniques are preferred in identifying clusters and associating cluster members; 2) Linear techniques perform better than non-linear techniques in comparing cluster densities; 3) UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) and t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) perform the best in identifying clusters and associating cluster members; 4) NMF(Nonnegative Matrix Factorization) has competitive performance in comparing distances among clusters; 5) t-SNLE(t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Linear Embedding) has competitive performance in comparing cluster densities.",

While dimensionality reduction techniques can be utilized to reduce the analysis space, these may unintentionally bury key dimensions within a larger grouping and obfuscate meaningful patterns. With this work we introduce DimLift, a novel visual analysis method for creating and interacting with dimensional bundles. Generated through an iterative dimensionality reduction or user-driven approach, dimensional bundles are expressive groups of dimensions that contribute similarly to the variance of a dataset. Interactive exploration and reconstruction methods via a layered parallel coordinates plot allow users to lift interesting and subtle relationships to the surface, even in complex scenarios of missing and mixed data types. We exemplify the power of this technique in an expert case study on clinical cohort data alongside two additional case examples from nutrition and ecology.",

Measuring inter-cluster reliability is crucial as it directly affects how well inter-cluster tasks (e.g., identifying cluster relationships in the original space from a projected view) can be conducted; however, despite the importance of inter-cluster tasks, we found that previous metrics, such as Trustworthiness and Continuity, fail to measure inter-cluster reliability. Our metrics consider two aspects of the inter-cluster reliability: Steadiness measures the extent to which clusters in the projected space form clusters in the original space, and Cohesiveness measures the opposite. They extract random clusters with arbitrary shapes and positions in one space and evaluate how much the clusters are stretched or dispersed in the other space. Furthermore, our metrics can quantify pointwise distortions, allowing for the visualization of inter-cluster reliability in a projection, which we call a reliability map. Through quantitative experiments, we verify that our metrics precisely capture the distortions that harm inter-cluster reliability while previous metrics have difficulty capturing the distortions. A case study also demonstrates that our metrics and the reliability map 1) support users in selecting the proper projection techniques or hyperparameters and 2) prevent misinterpretation while performing inter-cluster tasks, thus allow an adequate identification of inter-cluster structure.",

However, augmenting sports videos with such data visualizations is challenging, especially for sports analysts, as it requires considerable expertise in video editing. To ease the creation process, we present a design space that characterizes augmented sports videos at an element-level (what the constituents are) and clip-level (how those constituents are organized). We do so by systematically reviewing 233 examples of augmented sports videos collected from TV channels, teams, and leagues. The design space guides selection of data insights and visualizations for various purposes. Informed by the design space and close collaboration with domain experts, we design VisCommentator, a fast prototyping tool, to eases the creation of augmented table tennis videos by leveraging machine learning-based data extractors and design space-based visualization recommendations. With VisCommentator, sports analysts can create an augmented video by selecting the data to visualize instead of manually drawing the graphical marks. Our system can be generalized to other racket sports (e.g., tennis, badminton) once the underlying datasets and models are available. A user study with seven domain experts shows high satisfaction with our system, confirms that the participants can reproduce augmented sports videos in a short period, and provides insightful implications into future improvements and opportunities.",

In racket sports (e.g., tennis and badminton), a player hitting the ball is considered a multivariate event consisting of multiple attributes (e.g., hit technique and ball position). A rally (i.e., a series of consecutive hits beginning with one player serving the ball and ending with one player winning a point) thereby can be viewed as a multivariate event sequence. Mining frequent patterns and depicting how patterns change over time is instructive and meaningful to players who want to learn more short-term competitive strategies (i.e., tactics) that encompass multiple hits. However, players in racket sports usually change their tactics rapidly according to the opponent\u2019s reaction, resulting in ever-changing tactic progression. In this work, we introduce a tailored visualization system built on a novel multivariate sequence pattern mining algorithm to facilitate explorative identification and analysis of various tactics and tactic progression. The algorithm can mine multiple non-overlapping multivariate patterns from hundreds of sequences effectively. Based on the mined results, we propose a glyph-based Sankey diagram to visualize the ever-changing tactic progression and support interactive data exploration. Through two case studies with four domain experts in tennis and badminton, we demonstrate that our system can effectively obtain insights about tactic progression in most racket sports. We further discuss the strengths and the limitations of our system based on domain experts\u2019 feedback.",

In the frame view, we present a novel visual summarization method that combines risk-aware features and video context to enable quick video navigation. In the audio view, we employ a storyline-based design to provide a multi-faceted overview which can be used to explore audio content.

In this paper, we adopt a data-driven approach and propose OrderMonitor, a visual analytics system that assists warehouse managers in analyzing and improving order processing efficiency in real time based on streaming warehouse event data. Specifically, the order processing pipeline is visualized with a novel pipeline design based on the sedimentation metaphor to facilitate real-time order monitoring and suggest potentially abnormal orders. We also design a novel visualization that depicts order timelines based on the Gantt charts and Marey's graphs. Such a visualization helps the managers gain insights into the performance of order processing and find major blockers for delayed orders. Furthermore, an evaluating view is provided to assist users in inspecting order details and assigning priorities to improve the processing performance. The effectiveness of OrderMonitor is evaluated with two case studies on a real-world warehouse dataset.",

Moreover, challenges arise when multiple UX professionals need to collaborate to reduce bias and errors. We propose a collaborative visual analytics tool, CoUX, to facilitate UX evaluators collectively reviewing think-aloud usability test videos of digital interfaces. CoUX seamlessly supports usability problem identification, annotation, and discussion in an integrated environment. To ease the discovery of usability problems, CoUX visualizes a set of problem-indicators based on acoustic, textual, and visual features extracted from the video and audio of a think-aloud session with machine learning.CoUX further enables collaboration amongst UX evaluators for logging, commenting, and consolidating the discovered problems with a chatbox-like user interface. We designed CoUX based on a formative study with two UX experts and insights derived from the literature. We conducted a user study with six pairs of UX practitioners on collaborative think-aloud video analysis tasks. The results indicate that CoUX is useful and effective in facilitating both problem identification and collaborative teamwork. We provide insights into how different features of CoUX were used to support both independent analysis and collaboration. Furthermore, our work highlights opportunities to improve collaborative usability test video analysis.",

However, an individual's personality traits and cognitive abilities may also influence visualization use. Diverse user needs and abilities raise natural questions for specificity in visualization design: Could individuals from different domains exhibit performance differences when using visualizations? Are any systematic variations related to their cognitive abilities? This study bridges domain-specific perspectives on visualization design with those provided by cognition and perception. We measure variations in visualization task performance across chemistry, computer science, and education, and relate these differences to variations in spatial ability. We conducted an online study with over 60 domain experts consisting of tasks related to pie charts, isocontour plots, and 3D scatterplots, and grounded by a well-documented spatial ability test. Task performance (correctness) varied with profession across more complex visualizations (isocontour plots and scatterplots), but not pie charts, a comparatively common visualization. We found that correctness correlates with spatial ability, and the professions differ in terms of spatial ability. These results indicate that domains differ not only in the specifics of their data and tasks, but also in terms of how effectively their constituent members engage with visualizations and their cognitive traits. Analyzing participants' confidence and strategy comments suggests that focusing on performance neglects important nuances, such as differing approaches to engage with even common visualizations and potential skill transference. Our findings offer a fresh perspective on discipline-specific visualization with specific recommendations to help guide visualization design that celebrates the uniqueness of the disciplines and individuals we seek to serve.",

We find that there is little to no agreement in ordering of rainbow colors while sequential colors are indeed intuitively ordered by the participants with a strong dark is more bias. Sequential colors facilitate most quantitative map reading tasks better than the rainbow colors, whereas rainbow colors competitively facilitate extracting specific values from a map, and may support hue recall better than sequential.

However, despite the potential for knowledge sharing between these communities, we have little understanding of the ways in which practitioners design in real-world, professional settings. Inquiry in numerous design disciplines indicates that practitioners approach complex situations in ways that are fundamentally different from those of researchers. In this work, I take a practice-led approach to understanding design practice on its own terms. Twenty data visualization practitioners were interviewed and asked about their design process, including the steps they take, how they make decisions, and the methods they use. Findings suggest that practitioners do not follow highly systematic processes, but instead rely on situated forms of knowing and acting in which they draw from precedent and use methods and principles that are determined appropriate in the moment. These findings have implications for how visualization researchers understand and engage with practitioners, and how educators approach the training of future data visualization designers.",

Whether we are selecting from a set of visualizations, commissioning someone to produce them, or creating them ourselves, an effective way of specifying intent can help guide this process. Ideally, we would have a concise and shared specification language. In previous work, we have argued that communicative intents can be viewed as a learning/assessment problem (i.e., what should the reader learn and what test should they do well on). Learning-based specification formats are linked (e.g., assessments are derived from objectives) but some may more effectively specify communicative intent. Through a large-scale experiment, we studied three specification types: learning objectives, insights, and assessments. Participants, guided by one of these specifications, rated their preferences for a set of visualization designs. Then, we evaluated the set of visualization designs to assess which specification led participants to prefer the most effective visualizations. We find that while all specification types have benefits over no-specification, each format has its own advantages. Our results show that learning objective-based specifications helped participants the most in visualization selection. We also identify situations in which specifications may be insufficient and assessments are vital.",

But for many people, spreadsheets \u2014 the quintessential table tool \u2014 remain a critical part of their information ecosystem, allowing them to interact with their data in ways that are hidden or abstracted in more complex tools. This is particularly true for data workers [61], people who work with data as part of their job but do not identify as professional analysts or data scientists. We report on a qualitative study of how these workers interact with and reason about their data. Our findings show that data tables serve a broader purpose beyond data cleanup at the initial stage of a linear analytic flow: users want to see and \u201cget their hands on\u201d the underlying data throughout the analytics process, reshaping and augmenting it to support sensemaking. They reorganize, mark up, layer on levels of detail, and spawn alternatives within the context of the base data. These direct interactions and human-readable table representations form a rich and cognitively important part of building understanding of what the data mean and what they can do with it. We argue that interactive tables are an important visualization idiom in their own right; that the direct data interaction they afford offers a fertile design space for visual analytics; and that sense making can be enriched by more flexible human-data interaction than is currently supported in visual analytics tools.",

However, it is difficult to evaluate the usefulness of these descriptions, and how effectively they improve access to meaningful information, because we have little understanding of the semantic content they convey, and how different readers receive this content. In response, we introduce a conceptual model for the semantic content conveyed by natural language descriptions of visualizations. Developed through a grounded theory analysis of 2,147 sentences, our model spans four levels of semantic content: enumerating visualization construction properties (e.g., marks and encodings); reporting statistical concepts and relations (e.g., extrema and correlations); identifying perceptual and cognitive phenomena (e.g., complex trends and patterns); and elucidating domain-specific insights (e.g., social and political context). To demonstrate how our model can be applied to evaluate the effectiveness of visualization descriptions, we conduct a mixed-methods evaluation with 30 blind and 90 sighted readers, and find that these reader groups differ significantly on which semantic content they rank as most useful. Together, our model and findings suggest that access to meaningful information is strongly reader-specific, and that research in automatic visualization captioning should orient toward descriptions that more richly communicate overall trends and statistics, sensitive to reader preferences. Our work further opens a space of research on natural language as a data interface coequal with visualization.",

Regardless of how effective a visualization is, providing equal access for blind users requires a paradigm shift for the visualization research community. To enact such a shift, it is not sufficient to treat visualization accessibility as merely another technical problem to overcome. Instead, supporting the millions of blind and visually impaired users around the world who have equally valid needs for data analysis as sighted individuals requires a respectful, equitable, and holistic approach that includes all users from the onset. In this paper, we draw on accessibility research methodologies to make inroads towards such an approach. We first identify the people who have specific insight into how blind people perceive the world: orientation and mobility (O&M) experts, who are instructors that teach blind individuals how to navigate the physical world using non-visual senses. We interview 10 O&M experts\u2014all of them blind\u2014to understand how best to use sensory substitution other than the visual sense for conveying spatial layouts. Finally, we investigate our qualitative findings using thematic analysis. While blind people in general tend to use both sound and touch to understand their surroundings, we focused on auditory affordances and how they can be used to make data visualizations accessible\u2014using sonification and auralization. However, our experts recommended supporting a combination of senses\u2014sound and touch\u2014to make charts accessible as blind individuals may be more familiar with exploring tactile charts. We report results on both sound and touch affordances, and conclude by discussing implications for accessible visualization for blind individuals.",

The study findings suggest that participants actively try to construct an image of visualizations in their head while listening to alternative texts and wish to carry out visualization tasks (e.g., retrieve specific values) as sighted viewers would.

Deep neural network powered neural machine translation models have made great strides in many machine translation tasks, which suggests that they might be viable for NL2VIS as well. In this paper, we present ncNet, a Transformer-based sequence-to-sequence model for supporting NL2VIS, with several novel visualization-aware optimizations, including using attention-forcing to optimize the learning process, and visualization-aware rendering to produce better visualization result. To enhance the capability of machine to comprehend natural language queries, ncNet is also designed to take an optional chart template (e.g., a pie chart or a scatter plot) as input, where the chart template will be served as a constraint to limit what could be visualized. We conducted both quantitative evaluation and user study, showing that neural machine translation techniques are easy-to-use and achieve good accuracy that is comparable with the state-of-the-art NL2SQL result.",

The first study asks participants to verbalize what they see in scatterplots that depict various levels of orrelations. The second study then asks participants to choose visualizations that match a given verbal description of correlation. We extract key concepts from responses, organize them in a taxonomy and analyze the categorized responses. We observe that participants use a wide range of vocabulary across all scatterplots, but particular concepts are preferred for higher levels of correlation. A comparison between the studies reveals the ambiguity of some of the concepts. We discuss how the results could inform the design of multimodal representations aligned with the data and analytical tasks, and present a research roadmap to deepen the understanding about visualizations and natural language.",

The benefits of using simplicial spacetime meshes include (1) reducing ambiguity cases for feature extraction and tracking, (2) simplifying the handling of degeneracies using symbolic perturbations, and (3) enabling scalable and parallel processing. The use of simplicial spacetime meshing simplifies and improves the implementation of several feature-tracking algorithms for critical points, quantum vortices, and isosurfaces. As a software framework, FTK provides end users with VTK/ParaView filters, Python bindings, a command line interface, and programming interfaces for feature-tracking applications.

Our approach is based on a hierarchical representation of the input data and the fast identification of topologically invariant vertices, which are vertices that have no impact on the topological description of the data and for which we show that no computation is required as they are introduced in the hierarchy. This enables the definition of efficient coarse-to-fine topological algorithms, which leverage fast update mechanisms for ordinary vertices and avoid computation for the topologically invariant ones. We demonstrate our approach with two examples of topological algorithms (critical point extraction and persistence diagram computation), which generate interpretable outputs upon interruption requests and which progressively refine them otherwise. Experiments on real-life datasets illustrate that our progressive strategy, in addition to the continuous visual feedback it provides, even improves run time performance with regard to non-progressive algorithms and we describe further accelerations with shared-memory parallelism. We illustrate the utility of our approach in batch-mode and interactive setups, where it respectively enables the control of the execution time of complete topological pipelines as well as previews of the topological features found in a dataset, with progressive updates delivered within interactive times.",

This paper introduces a scalable, parallel and distributed algorithm for merge tree construction outperforming the previously fastest distributed solution by a factor of around three. This is achieved by a task-parallel identification of individual merge tree arcs by growing regions around critical points in the data, without any need for ordered progression or global data structures, based on a novel insight introducing a sufficient local boundary for region growth.",

We extend recent work on the edit distance and introduce a new metric, called the Wasserstein distance between merge trees, which is purposely designed to enable efficient computations of geodesics and barycenters. Specifically, our new distance is strictly equivalent to the L 2 -Wasserstein distance between extremum persistence diagrams, but it is restricted to a smaller solution space, namely, the space of rooted partial isomorphisms between branch decomposition trees. This enables a simple extension of existing optimization frameworks for geodesics and barycenters from persistence diagrams to merge trees. We introduce a task-based algorithm which can be generically applied to distance, geodesic, barycenter or cluster computation. The task-based nature of our approach enables further accelerations with shared-memory parallelism. Extensive experiments on public ensembles and SciVis contest benchmarks demonstrate the efficiency of our approach \u2013 with barycenter computations in the orders of minutes for the largest examples \u2013 as well as its qualitative ability to generate representative barycenter merge trees, visually summarizing the features of interest found in the ensemble.

In many applications, computing distances between diagrams is essential; however, computing these distances has been challenging due to the computational cost. In this paper, we propose a persistence diagram hashing framework that learns a binary code representation of persistence diagrams, which allows for fast computation of distances. This framework is built upon a generative adversarial network (GAN) with a diagram distance loss function to steer the learning process. Instead of using standard representations, we hash diagrams into binary codes, which have natural advantages in large-scale tasks. The training of this model is domain-oblivious in that it can be computed purely from synthetic, randomly created diagrams. As a consequence, our proposed method is directly applicable to various datasets without the need for retraining the model. These binary codes, when compared using fast Hamming distance, better maintain topological similarity properties between datasets than other vectorized representations. To evaluate this method, we apply our framework to the problem of diagram clustering and we compare the quality and performance of our approach to the state-of-the-art. In addition, we show the scalability of our approach on a dataset with 10k persistence diagrams, which is not possible with current techniques. Moreover, our experimental results demonstrate that our method is significantly faster with the potential of less memory usage, while retaining comparable or better quality comparisons.",

Due to the vast combinations of data variables and visual encodings that are possible, it is often challenging to make such decisions. Further, while performing local explorations, analysts often fail to attend to the holistic picture that is emerging from their analysis, leading them to improperly steer their EVA. These issues become even more impactful in the real world analysis scenarios where EVA occurs in multiple asynchronous sessions that could be completed by one or more analysts. To address these challenges, this work proposes ChartSeer, a system that uses machine intelligence to enable analysts to visually monitor the current state of an EVA and effectively identify future activities to perform. ChartSeer utilizes deep learning techniques to characterize analyst-created data charts to generate visual summaries and recommend appropriate charts for further exploration based on user interactions. A case study was first conducted to demonstrate the usage of ChartSeer in practice, followed by a controlled study to compare ChartSeer\u2019s performance with a baseline during EVA tasks. The results demonstrated that ChartSeer enables analysts to adequately understand current EVA status and advance their analysis by creating charts with increased coverage and visual encoding diversity.",

Current automatic network visualization tools focus on debugging the network itself and are not ideal for generating publication visualizations. Therefore, we present an approach to automate this process by translating network architectures specified in Keras into visualizations that can directly be embedded into any publication. To do so, we propose a visual grammar for convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which has been derived from an analysis of such figures extracted from all ICCV and CVPR papers published between 2013 and 2019. The proposed grammar incorporates visual encoding, network layout, layer aggregation, and legend generation. We have further realized our approach in an online system available to the community, which we have evaluated through expert feedback, and a quantitative study. It not only reduces the time needed to generate network visualizations for publications, but also enables a unified and unambiguous visualization design.",

We describe an integrated environment for visual analysis and knowledge discovery from cancer therapy symptom data, developed in close collaboration with oncology experts. Our visual environment leverages unsupervised machine learning methodology over cohorts of patients, and, in conjunction with custom visual encodings and interactions, provides context for new patients based on patients with similar diagnostic features and symptom evolution. We evaluate this environment on data collected from a cohort of head and neck cancer patients. Feedback from our clinician collaborators indicates that this environment supports knowledge discovery beyond the limits of machines or humans alone, and that it serves as a valuable tool in both the clinic and symptom research.",

Existing automated approaches for recommending multiple-view visualizations mainly build on manually crafted design rules, producing sub-optimal or irrelevant suggestions. To address this gap, we present a deep learning approach for selecting data columns and recommending multiple charts.

The complexity of such technologies makes it challenging to evaluate the performance of autonomous driving systems and to find ways to improve them. The current approaches to evaluating such autonomous driving systems largely use a single score to indicate the overall performance of a system, but domain experts have difficulties in understanding how individual components or algorithms in an autonomous driving system may contribute to the score. To address this problem, we collaborate with domain experts on autonomous driving algorithms, and propose a visual evaluation method for autonomous driving. Our method considers the data generated in all components during the whole process of autonomous driving, including perception results, planning routes, prediction of obstacles, various controlling parameters, and evaluation of comfort. We develop a visual analytics workflow to integrate an evaluation mathematical model with adjustable parameters, support the evaluation of the system from the level of the overall performance to the level of detailed measures of individual components, and to show both evaluation scores and their contributing factors. Our implemented visual analytics system provides an overview evaluation score at the beginning and shows the animation of the dynamic change of the scores at each period. Experts can interactively explore the specific component at different time periods and identify related factors. With our method, domain experts not only learn about the performance of an autonomous driving system, but also identify and access the problematic parts of each component. Our visual evaluation system can be applied to the autonomous driving simulation system and used for various evaluation cases. The results of using our system in some simulation cases and the feedback from involved domain experts confirm the usefulness and efficiency of our method in helping people gain in-depth insight into autonomous driving systems.",

In this work, we propose VASS, a Visual Analytics approach to diagnosing and improving the accuracy and robustness of Semantic Segmentation models, especially for critical objects moving in various driving scenes. The key component of our approach is a context-aware spatial representation learning that extracts important spatial information of objects, such as position, size, and aspect ratio, with respect to given scene contexts. Based on this spatial representation, we first use it to create visual summarization to analyze models\u2019 performance. We then use it to guide the generation of adversarial examples to evaluate models\u2019 spatial robustness and obtain actionable insights. We demonstrate the effectiveness of VASS via two case studies of lost cargo detection and pedestrian detection in autonomous driving. For both cases, we show quantitative evaluation on the improvement of models\u2019 performance with actionable insights obtained from VASS.",

However, recovering causal relations from these observations to explain the sources of urban phenomena remains a challenging task because these causal relations tend to be time-varying and demand proper time series partitioning for effective analyses. The prior approaches extract one causal graph given long-time observations, which cannot be directly applied to capturing, interpreting, and validating dynamic urban causality. This paper presents Compass, a novel visual analytics approach for in-depth analyses of the dynamic causality in urban time series. To develop Compass, we identify and address three challenges: detecting urban causality, interpreting dynamic causal relations, and unveiling suspicious causal relations. First, multiple causal graphs over time among urban time series are obtained with a causal detection framework extended from the Granger causality test. Then, a dynamic causal graph visualization is designed to reveal the time-varying causal relations across these causal graphs and facilitate the exploration of the graphs along the time. Finally, a tailored multi-dimensional visualization is developed to support the identification of spurious causal relations, thereby improving the reliability of causal analyses. The effectiveness of Compass is evaluated with two case studies conducted on the real-world urban datasets, including the air pollution and traffic speed datasets, and positive feedback was received from domain experts.",

Analyzing such cascading processes presents valuable implications in various urban applications, such as traffic planning and pollution diagnostics. Motivated by the limited capability of the existing approaches in mining and interpreting cascading patterns, we propose a visual analytics system called VisCas. VisCas combines an inference model with interactive visualizations and empowers analysts to infer and interpret the latent cascading patterns in the spatiotemporal context. To develop VisCas, we address three major challenges, 1) generalized pattern inference, 2) implicit influence visualization, and 3) multifaceted cascade analysis. For the first challenge, we adapt the state-of-the-art cascading network inference technique to general urban scenarios, where cascading patterns can be reliably inferred from large-scale spatiotemporal data. For the second and third challenges, we assemble a set of effective visualizations to support location navigation, influence inspection, and cascading exploration, and facilitate the in-depth cascade analysis. We design a novel influence view based on a three-fold optimization strategy for analyzing the implicit influences of the inferred patterns. We demonstrate the capability and effectiveness of VisCas with two case studies conducted on real-world traffic congestion and air pollution datasets with domain experts.",

Current approaches overcome this problem by using focus on specific elements that are then rendered opaque, and carving away all elements occluding their view. In this work, we make use of advanced GPU shader functionality to generate a focus+context rendering that highlights the elements in a selected region and simultaneously conveys the global mesh structure and deformation field. To achieve this, we propose a gradual transition from edge-based focus rendering to volumetric context rendering, by combining fragment shader-based edge and face rendering with per-pixel fragment lists. A fragment shader smoothly transitions between wireframe and face-based rendering, including focus-dependent rendering style and depth-dependent edge thickness and halos, and per-pixel fragment lists are used to blend fragments in correct visibility order. To maintain the global mesh structure in the context regions, we propose a new method to construct a sheet-based level-of-detail hierarchy and smoothly blend it with volumetric information. The user guides the exploration process by moving a lens-like hotspot. Since all operations are performed on the GPU, interactive frame rates are achieved even for large meshes.",

This differentiable renderer is used to steer the parameters towards a setting with an optimal solution of a problem-specific objective function. We have tailored the approach to volume rendering by enforcing a constant memory footprint via analytic inversion of the blending functions. This makes it independent of the number of sampling steps through the volume and facilitates the consideration of small-scale changes. The approach forms the basis for automatic optimizations regarding external parameters of the rendering process and the volumetric density field itself. We demonstrate its use for automatic viewpoint selection using differentiable entropy as objective, and for optimizing a transfer function from rendered images of a given volume. Optimization of per-voxel densities is addressed in two different ways: First, we mimic inverse tomography and optimize a 3D density field from images using an absorption model. This simplification enables comparisons with algebraic reconstruction techniques and state-of-the-art differentiable path tracers. Second, we introduce a novel approach for tomographic reconstruction from images using an emission-absorption model with post-shading via an arbitrary transfer function.",

Specifically, we demonstrate how to use these units to accelerate the point location of general unstructured elements consisting of both planar and bilinear faces. This unstructured mesh point location problem has previously been challenging to accelerate on GPU architectures; yet, the performance of these queries is crucial to many unstructured volume rendering and compute applications. Starting with a CUDA reference method, we describe and evaluate three approaches that reformulate these point queries to incrementally map algorithmic complexity to these new hardware ray tracing units. Each variant replaces the simpler problem of point queries with a more complex one of ray queries. Initial variants exploit ray tracing cores for accelerated BVH traversal, and subsequent variants use ray-triangle intersections and per-face metadata to detect point-in-element intersections. Although these later variants are more algorithmically complex, they are significantly faster than the reference method thanks to hardware acceleration. Using our approach, we improve the performance of an unstructured volume renderer by up to 4\u00d7 for tetrahedral meshes and up to 15\u00d7 for general bilinear element meshes, matching, or out-performing state-of-the-art solutions while simultaneously improving on robustness and ease-of-implementation.",

Although it is impossible to super-sample all particles of large-scale data at interactive rates, efficient occlusion culling can decouple the overall data size from a high effective sampling rate of visible particles. However, while the latter is essential for domain scientists to be able to see important data features, performing occlusion culling by sampling or sorting the data is usually slow or error-prone due to visibility estimates of insufficient quality. We present a novel probabilistic culling architecture for super-sampled high-quality rendering of large particle data. Occlusion is dynamically determined at the sub-pixel level, without explicit visibility sorting or data simplification. We introduce confidence maps to probabilistically estimate confidence in the visibility data gathered so far. This enables progressive, confidence-based culling, helping to avoid wrong visibility decisions. In this way, we determine particle visibility with high accuracy, although only a small part of the data set is sampled. This enables extensive super-sampling of (partially) visible particles for high rendering quality, at a fraction of the cost of sampling all particles. For real-time performance with millions of particles, we exploit novel features of recent GPU architectures to group particles into two hierarchy levels, combining fine-grained culling with high frame rates.",

We use these data to study career mobility from a historical perspective and understand social mobility and inequality.

We propose CareerLens, an interactive visual analytics system for assisting experts in exploring, understanding, and reasoning from historical career data. With CareerLens, experts examine mobility patterns in three levels-of-detail, namely, the macro-level providing a summary of overall mobility, the meso-level extracting latent group mobility patterns, and the micro-level revealing social relationships of individuals.

EVis also provides a novel visual analytics approach to allowing users to discover temporally lagging relationships related to antecedent conditions between events and multiple variables, a critical task in Earth sciences. In particular, this latter approach projects multivariate time series onto trajectories in a 2D space using RadViz, and clusters the trajectories for temporal pattern discovery.

Examples include searching for proper data in a large event space, understanding stories of historical events by time and space, and finding relationships among events that may not be apparent. Instructors who extensively use well-organized and well-argued materials (e.g., textbooks and online resources) can lead students to a narrow perspective in understanding history and prevent spontaneous investigation of historical events, with the students asking their own questions. In this work, we proposed HisVA, a visual analytics system that allows the efficient exploration of historical events from Wikipedia using three views: event, map, and resource. HisVA provides an effective event exploration space, where users can investigate relationships among historical events by reviewing and linking them in terms of space and time. To evaluate our system, we present two usage scenarios, a user study with a qualitative analysis of user exploration strategies, and in-class deployment results",

In scientific visualization, SSR-TVD is the first work that applies the generative adversarial network (GAN) to generate high-resolution volumes for three-dimensional time-varying data sets. The design of SSR-TVD includes a generator and two discriminators (spatial and temporal discriminators). The generator takes a low-resolution volume as input and outputs a synthesized high-resolution volume. To capture spatial and temporal coherence in the volume sequence, the two discriminators take the synthesized high-resolution volume(s) as input and produce a score indicating the realness of the volume(s). Our method can work in the in situ visualization setting by downscaling volumetric data from selected time steps as the simulation runs and upscaling downsampled volumes to their original resolution during postprocessing. To demonstrate the effectiveness of SSR-TVD, we show quantitative and qualitative results with several time-varying data sets of different characteristics and compare our method against volume upscaling using bicubic interpolation and a solution solely based on CNN.",

Recent work has shown that some visualization designs can better support cognitive processes and mitigate cognitive biases (i.e., errors that occur due to the use of mental \u201cshortcuts\u201d). In this work, we explore how visualizing a user\u2019s interaction history (i.e., which data points a user has interacted with) can be used to mitigate potential biases that drive decision making by promoting conscious reflection of one\u2019s analysis process. Given an interactive scatterplot-based visualization tool, we showed interaction history in real-time while exploring data (e.g., by coloring points in the scatterplot that the user has interacted with), and in a summative format after a decision has been made (e.g., by comparing the distribution of user interactions to the underlying distribution of the data). We conducted a series of in-lab experiments and a crowdsourced experiment to evaluate the effectiveness of interaction history interventions toward mitigating bias. We contextualized this work in a political scenario in which participants were instructed to choose a committee of 10 fictitious politicians to review a recent bill passed in the U.S. state of Georgia banning abortion after 6 weeks, where e.g. gender bias or political party bias may drive one\u2019s analysis process. We demonstrate the generalizability of this approach by evaluating a second decision making scenario related to movies. Our results are inconclusive for the effectiveness of interaction history (henceforth referred to as interaction traces) toward mitigating biased decision making. However, we find some mixed support that interaction traces, particularly in a summative format, can increase awareness of potential unconscious biases.",

Recent research has shown that state-of-the-art models tend to produce answers exploiting biases and shortcuts in the training data, and sometimes do not even look at the input image, instead of performing the required reasoning steps. We present VisQA, a visual analytics tool that explores this question of reasoning vs. bias exploitation. It exposes the key element of state-of-the-art neural models --- attention maps in transformers. Our working hypothesis is that reasoning steps leading to model predictions are observable from attention distributions, which are particularly useful for visualization. The design process of VisQA was motivated by well-known bias examples from the fields of deep learning and vision-language reasoning and evaluated in two ways. First, as a result of a collaboration of three fields, machine learning, vision and language reasoning, and data analytics, the work lead to a better understanding of bias exploitation of neural models for VQA, which eventually resulted in an impact on its design and training through the proposition of a method for the transfer of reasoning patterns from an oracle model. Second, we also report on the design of VisQA, and a goal-oriented evaluation of VisQA targeting the analysis of a model decision process from multiple experts, providing evidence that it makes the inner workings of models accessible to users.",

We explore a potential misinterpretation of trivariate scatterplots, which we call the weighted average illusion, where locations of larger and darker points are given more weight toward x- and y-mean estimates. This systematic bias is sensitive to a designer\u2019s choice of size or lightness ranges mapped onto the data. In this paper, we quantify this bias against varying size/lightness ranges and data correlations. We discuss possible explanations for its cause by measuring attention given to individual data points using a vision science technique called the centroid method. Our work illustrates how ensemble processing mechanisms and mental shortcuts can significantly distort visual summaries of data, and can lead to misjudgments like the demonstrated weighted average illusion.",

With progressive visualization, users can examine intermediate results of complex or long running computations, without waiting for the computation to complete. While this has shown to be beneficial to users, recent research has identified potential risks. For example, users may misjudge the uncertainty in the intermediate results and draw incorrect conclusions or see patterns that are not present in the final results. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive set of studies to quantify the advantages and limitations of progressive visualization. Based on a recent report by Micallef et al., we examine four types of cognitive biases that can occur with progressive visualization: uncertainty bias, illusion bias, control bias, and anchoring bias. The results of the studies suggest a cautious but promising use of progressive visualization \u2014 while there can be significant savings in task completion time, accuracy can be negatively affected in certain conditions. These findings confirm earlier reports of the benefits and drawbacks of progressive visualization and that continued research into mitigating the effects of cognitive biases is necessary.",

This work introduces a novel visual approach designed to reveal the presence of confounding variables via counterfactual possibilities during visual data analysis. It is implemented in CoFact, an interactive visualization prototype that determines and visualizes counterfactual subsets to better support user exploration of feature relationships. Using publicly available datasets, we conducted a controlled user study to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach; the results indicate that users exposed to counterfactual visualizations formed more careful judgments about feature-to-outcome relationships.",

Using in-situ (at the place of interaction) and ex-situ (in an external view) visualization techniques, Lumos provides real-time feedback to users for them to reflect on their activities. For example, Lumos highlights datapoints that have been previously examined in the same visualization (in-situ) and also overlays them on the underlying data distribution (i.e., baseline distribution) in a separate visualization (ex-situ). Through a user study with 24 participants, we investigate how Lumos helps users' data exploration and decision-making processes. We found that Lumos increases users' awareness of visual data analysis practices in real-time, promoting reflection upon and acknowledgement of their intentions and potentially influencing subsequent interactions.",

Clustered graphs are often used to model relationships that are accompanied by attribute-based grouping information. Such information is essential for robust data analysis, such as for the study of biological taxonomies or educational backgrounds. Hence, the ability to smartly arrange textual labels and packing graphs within a certain screen space is therefore desired to successfully convey the attribute data . Here we propose to hierarchically partition the input screen space using Voronoi tessellations in multiple levels of detail. In our method, the position of textual labels is guided by the blending of constrained forces and the forces derived from centroidal Voronoi cells. The proposed algorithm considers three main factors: (1) area balancing, (2) schematized space partitioning, and (3) hairball management. We primarily focus on area balancing, which aims to allocate a uniform area for each textual label in the diagram. We achieve this by first untangling a general graph to a clustered graph through textual label duplication, and then coupling with spanning-tree-like visual integration. We illustrate the feasibility of our approach with examples and then evaluate our method by comparing it with well-known conventional approaches and collecting feedback from domain experts.",

MissBiN equips a novel method for link prediction in a bipartite network by leveraging the information of bi-cliques in the network. It also provides an interactive visualization for understanding the algorithm outputs. The design of MissBiN is based on three high-level analysis questions (what, why, and how) regarding missing links, which are distilled from the literature and expert interviews. We conducted quantitative experiments to assess the performance of the proposed link prediction algorithm, and interviewed two experts from different domains to demonstrate the effectiveness of MissBiN as a whole. We also provide a comprehensive usage scenario to illustrate the usefulness of the tool in an application of intelligence analysis.",

In this paper, we focus on the collection of tasks for tree visualizations, a common visual encoding in many domains ranging from biology to computer science to geography. In spite of their commonality, no prior efforts exist to collect and abstractly define tree visualization tasks. We present a literature review of tree visualization papers and generate a curated dataset of over 200 tasks. To enable effective task abstraction for trees, we also contribute a novel extension of the Multi-Level Task Typology to include more specificity to support tree-specific tasks as well as a systematic procedure to conduct task abstractions for tree visualizations. All tasks in the dataset were abstracted with the novel typology extension and analyzed to gain a better understanding of the state of tree visualizations. These abstracted tasks can benefit visualization researchers and practitioners as they design evaluation studies or compare their analytical tasks with ones previously studied in the literature to make informed decisions about their design. We also reflect on our novel methodology and advocate more broadly for the creation of task-based knowledge repositories for different types of visualizations.

All edge bundling techniques to date implicitly or explicitly cluster groups of individual edges, or parts of them, together based on these attributes. These clusters can result in ambiguous connections that do not exist in the data. Confluent drawings of networks do not have these ambiguities, but require the layout to be computed as part of the bundling process. We devise a new bundling method, edge-path bundling, to simplify edge clutter while greatly reducing ambiguities compared to previous bundling techniques. Edge-path bundling takes a layout as input and clusters each edge along a weighted, shortest path to limit its deviation from a straight line. Edge-path bundling does not incur independent edge ambiguities typically seen in all edge bundling methods, and the level of bundling can be tuned through shortest path distances, Euclidean distances, and combinations of the two. Also, directed edge bundling naturally emerges from the model. Through metric evaluations, we demonstrate the advantages of edge-path bundling over other techniques.",

                        "abstract": "Node-link visualizations are a familiar and powerful tool for displaying the relationships in a network. The readability of these visualizations highly depends on the spatial layout used for the nodes. In this paper, we focus on computing layered layouts, in which nodes are aligned on a set of parallel axes to better expose hierarchical or sequential relationships. Heuristic-based layouts are widely used as they scale well to larger networks and usually create readable, albeit sub-optimal, visualizations. We instead use a layout optimization model that prioritizes optimality (as compared to scalability) because an optimal solution not only represents the best attainable result, but can also serve as a baseline to evaluate the effectiveness of layout heuristics. We take an important step towards powerful and flexible network visualization by proposing Stratisfimal Layout, a modular integer-linear-programming formulation that can consider several important readability criteria simultaneously: crossing reduction, edge bendiness, and nested and multi-layer groups. The layout can be adapted to diverse use cases through its modularity. Individual features can be enabled and customized depending on the application. We provide open-source and documented implementations of the layout, both for web-based and desktop visualizations. As a proof-of-concept, we apply it to the problem of visualizing complicated SQL queries, which have features that, to the best of our knowledge, cannot be addressed by existing layout optimization models. We also include a benchmark network generator and the results of an empirical evaluation to assess the performance trade-offs of our design choices.

Examples include social networks, knowledge graphs, control-flow graphs in programs, and semantic scene graphs in images. Identifying subgraph patterns (or motifs) in graphs is one important approach to understand their structural properties. We propose a visual analytics system, GraphQ to support human-in-the-loop, example-based, subgraph pattern search in a database containing many individual graphs. Our approach goes beyond a predefined set of motifs and allows users to interactively specify the patterns of interest. To support fast, interactive queries, we use graph neural networks (GNNs) to encode the topological and node attributes in a graph as fixed-length\n  latent vector representations, and perform subgraph matching in the latent space. However, due to the complexity of the problem, it is still difficult to obtain accurate one-to-one node correspondence in the matching results, which is crucial for visualization and\n  interpretation. We, therefore, propose a novel GNN for node-alignment called NeuroAlign, to facilitate easy validation and interpretation of the query results. GraphQ provides a visual query interface with a query editor and a multi-scale visualization of the results, as well as a user feedback mechanism for refining the results with additional constraints. We demonstrate GraphQ through two example usage scenarios in different application domains: analyzing reusable subroutines in program workflows and semantic scene graph search in images. Quantitative experiments show that NeuroAlign achieves 19%\u201329% improvement in node-alignment accuracy compared to baseline GNN and provides up to 100x speedup compared to combinatorial algorithms. Our qualitative study with domain experts confirms the effectiveness of GraphQ for both usage scenarios.",

The narrative structure of a data story serves as the backbone that determines its expressiveness, and it can largely influence how audiences perceive the insights. Freytag's Pyramid is a classic narrative structure that has been widely used in film and literature. While there are continuous recommendations and discussions about applying Freytag's Pyramid to data stories, there is little systematic and practical guidance for data story creators on how to use Freytag's Pyramid for structured data story creation. To bridge this gap, we examined how existing practices apply Freytag's Pyramid through analyzing stories extracted from 103 data videos. Based on our findings, we propose a design space of narrative patterns, data flows, and visual communications to provide practical guidance on achieving narrative intents, organizing data facts, and selecting visual design techniques through the story creation process. We evaluated the proposed design space through a workshop with 25 participants. The results show that our design space provides a clear framework for rapid storyboarding of data stories with Freytag's Pyramid.",

These five affects were found to be frequently communicated through animation in data stories. Regarding each affect, we designed varied kinetic motions represented by bar charts, line charts, and pie charts, resulting in 60 animated charts for the five affects. We designed Kineticharts by first conducting a need-finding study with professional practitioners from data journalism and then analyzing a corpus of affective motion graphics to identify salient kinetic patterns. We evaluated Kineticharts through two user studies. The results suggest that Kineticharts can accurately convey affects, and improve the expressiveness of data stories, as well as enhance user engagement without hindering data comprehension compared to the animation design from DataClips, an authoring tool for data videos.",

Data comics are an effective and versatile means for visual communication, leveraging the power of sequential narration and combined textual and visual content, while providing an overview of the storyline through panels assembled in expressive layouts. While a powerful static storytelling medium that works well on paper support, adding interactivity to data comics can enable non-linear storytelling, personalization, levels of details, explanations, and potentially enriched user experiences. This paper introduces a set of operations tailored to support data comics narrative goals that go beyond the traditional linear, immutable storyline curated by a story author. The goals and operations include adding and removing panels into pre-defined layouts to support branching, change of perspective, or access to detail-on-demand, as well as providing and modifying data, and interacting with data representation, to support personalization and reader-defined data focus. We propose a lightweight specification language, COMICSCRIPT, for designers to add such interactivity to static comics. To assess the viability of our authoring process, we recruited six professional illustrators, designers and data comics enthusiasts and asked them to craft an interactive comic, allowing us to understand authoring workflow and potential of our approach. We present examples of interactive comics in a gallery. This initial step towards understanding the design space of interactive comics can inform the design of creation tools and experiences for interactive storytelling.",

The visualization practitioner community prescribes two popular guidelines for creating clear and efficient visualizations: declutter and focus. The declutter guidelines suggest removing non-critical gridlines, excessive labeling of data values, and color variability to improve aesthetics and to maximize the emphasis on the data relative to the design itself. The focus guidelines for explanatory communication recommend including a clear headline that describes the relevant data pattern, highlighting a subset of relevant data values with a unique color, and connecting those values to written annotations that contextualize them in a broader argument. We evaluated how these recommendations impact recall of the depicted information across cluttered, decluttered, and decluttered+focused designs of six graph topics. Undergraduate students were asked to redraw previously seen visualizations, to recall their topics and main conclusions, and to rate the varied designs on aesthetics, clarity, professionalism, and trustworthiness. Decluttering designs led to higher ratings on professionalism, and adding focus to the design led to higher ratings on aesthetics and clarity. They also showed better memory for the highlighted pattern in the data, as reflected across redrawings of the original visualization and typed free-response conclusions, though we do not know whether these results would generalize beyond our memory-based tasks. The results largely empirically validate the intuitions of visualization designers and practitioners.

Despite preliminary empirical work and a few web essays written by practitioners, there is a lack of clear language for thinking about and communicating about anthropographics. We address this gap by introducing a conceptual framework and a design space for anthropographics. Our design space consists of seven elementary design dimensions that can be reasonably hypothesized to have some effect on prosocial feelings or behavior. It extends a previous design space and is informed by an analysis of 105 visualizations collected from newspapers, websites, and research papers. We use our conceptual framework and design space to discuss trade-offs, common design strategies, as well as future opportunities for design and research in the area of anthropographics.",

Using simple bar charts as a case study, we empirically tested the comparison affordances of four common arrangements: vertically juxtaposed, horizontally juxtaposed, overlaid, and stacked. We asked participants to type out what patterns they perceived in a chart and we coded their takeaways into types of comparisons. In a second study, we asked data visualization design experts to predict which arrangement they would use to afford each type of comparison and found both alignments and mismatches with our findings.

Diatoms allows for a degree of randomness while respecting constraints imposed by columns in a data table: their data types and domains as well as semantic associations between columns as specified by the designer. We pair this generative design process with two forms of interactive design externalization that enable comparison and critique of the design alternatives. First, we incorporate a familiar small multiples configuration in which every data point is drawn according to a single glyph design, coupled with the ability to page between alternative glyph designs. Second, we propose a small permutables design gallery, in which a single data point is drawn according to each alternative glyph design, coupled with the ability to page between data points. We demonstrate an implementation of our technique as an extension to Tableau featuring three example palettes, and to better understand how Diatoms could fit into existing design workflows, we conducted interviews and chauffeured demos with 12 designers. Finally, we reflect on our process and the designers\u2019 reactions, discussing the potential of our technique in the context of visualization authoring systems. Ultimately, our approach to glyph design and comparison can kickstart and inspire visualization design, allowing for the serendipitous discovery of shape and channel combinations that would have otherwise been overlooked.",

However, the creation of circular glyphs remains a difficult task due to the demand for professional design skills and laborious design processes. This paper presents an interactive authoring tool called GlyphCreator to support the example-based generation of circular glyphs. Given an example circular glyph and multidimensional input data, GlyphCreator can promptly generate a list of design candidates and supports interactive editing on the candidates to satisfy different design requirements. To develop GlyphCreator, we first derive a design space of circular glyphs from summarizing the relation between different visual elements. With this design space, we build a circular glyph dataset and develop a deep learning model for glyph parsing. The model is able to deconstruct a circular glyph bitmap into a series of visual elements. Next, we propose an interface with effective interactions to help users bind the input data attributes to visual elements and customize visual styles. We evaluate the parsing model through a quantitative experiment and demonstrate the use of GlyphCreator through a usage scenario. The effectiveness of GlyphCreator is confirmed through user interviews.",

Given a set of star glyphs associated to multiple class labels, we propose to use shape context descriptors to measure the perceptual distance between pairs of glyphs, and use the derived silhouette coefficient to measure the perception of class separability within the entire set. To find the optimal coordinate order for the given set, we train a neural network using reinforcement learning to reward orderings with high silhouette coefficients. The network consists of an encoder and a decoder with an attention mechanism. The encoder employs a recurrent neural network (RNN) to encode input shape and class information, while the decoder together with the attention mechanism employs another RNN to output a sequence with the new coordinate order. In addition, we introduce a neural network to efficiently estimate the similarity between shape context descriptors, which allows to speed up the computation of silhouette coefficients and thus the training of the axis ordering network. Two user studies demonstrate that the orders provided by our method are preferred by users for perceiving class separation. We tested our model on different settings to show its robustness and generalization abilities and demonstrate that it allows to order input sets with unseen data size, data dimension, or number of classes. We also demonstrate that our model can be adapted to coordinate ordering of other types of plots such as RadViz by replacing the proposed shape-aware silhouette coefficient with the corresponding quality metric to guide network training.",

We also developed a testing framework and performed user studies to evaluate the various glyph-based tensor visualizations for objective accuracy measures, and subjective user feedback for each visualization method. To represent the stress tensor, we color encoded the original superquadric glyph, and in the user study, we compared it to superquadric glyphs developed for second-order symmetric tensors. We found that color encoding improved the user accuracy measures, while the users also rated our method the highest. We compared our method of placing stress tensor glyphs on displacement streamlines to the glyph placement on a 3D grid. In the visualization, we modified the glyph to show both the stress tensor and the displacement vector at each sample point. The participants preferred our method of glyph placement on displacement streamlines as it highlighted the underlying continuous structure in the tensor field.",

Encoding edge probability using visual variables like width or fuzziness makes it dif\ufb01cult for users of static network visualizations to estimate network statistics like densities, isolates, path lengths, or clustering under uncertainty. We introduce Network Hypothetical Outcome Plots (NetHOPs), a visualization technique that animates a sequence of network realizations sampled from a network distribution de\ufb01ned by probabilistic edges. NetHOPs employ an aggregation and anchoring algorithm used in dynamic and longitudinal graph drawing to parameterize layout stability to support uncertainty estimation. We present a community matching algorithm we developed to enable visualizing the uncertainty of cluster membership and community occurrence. We describe the results of a study in which 51 network experts used NetHOPs to complete a set of common visual analysis tasks and reported how they perceived network structures and properties subject to uncertainty. Participants\u2019 estimates fell, on average, within 11% of the ground truth statistics, suggesting NetHOPs can be a reasonable approach for enabling network analysts to reason about multiple properties under uncertainty. Participants appeared able to articulate the distribution of network statistics slightly more accurately when they could manipulate the layout anchoring and the animation speed. Based on these \ufb01ndings, we synthesize design recommendations for developing and using animated network visualizations for probabilistic networks.",

Being embedded within an archaeological project, we realized how assessing such qualitative uncertainty is crucial in gaining a holistic and accurate understanding of regional spatio-temporal patterns of human settlements over millennia. We therefore investigated the impact of visualizing qualitative implicit errors on the sense-making process via a probe that deliberately represented three distinct implicit errors, i.e. differing collection methods, subjectivity of data interpretations and assumptions on temporal continuity. By analyzing the interactions of 14 archaeologists with different levels of domain expertise, we discovered that novices became more actively aware of typically overlooked data issues and domain experts became more confident of the visualization itself. We observed how participants quoted social factors to alleviate some uncertainty, while in order to minimize it they requested additional contextual breadth or depth of the data. While our visualization did not alleviate all uncertainty, we recognized how it sparked reflective meta-insights regarding methodological directions of the data. We believe our findings inform future visualizations on how to handle the complexity of implicit errors for a range of user typologies and for highly data-critical application domains such as the digital humanities.",

Prior work demonstrates mixed performance outcomes with respect to how individuals make decisions using various visual and textual depictions of uncertainty. Part of the inconsistency across findings may be due to an over-reliance on task accuracy, which cannot, on its own, provide a comprehensive understanding of how uncertainty visualization techniques support reasoning processes. In this work, we advance the debate surrounding the efficacy of modern 1D uncertainty visualizations by conducting converging quantitative and qualitative analyses of both the effort and strategies used by individuals when provided with quantile dotplots, density plots, interval plots, mean plots, and textual descriptions of uncertainty. We utilize two approaches for examining effort across uncertainty communication techniques: a measure of individual differences in working-memory capacity known as an operation span (OSPAN) task and self-reports of perceived workload via the NASA-TLX. The results reveal that both visualization methods and working-memory capacity impact participants' decisions. Specifically, quantile dotplots and density plots (i.e., distributional annotations) result in more accurate judgments than interval plots, textual descriptions of uncertainty, and mean plots (i.e., summary annotations). Additionally, participants' open-ended responses suggest that individuals viewing distributional annotations are more likely to employ a strategy that explicitly incorporates uncertainty into their judgments than those viewing summary annotations. When comparing quantile dotplots to density plots, this work finds that both methods are equally effective for low-working-memory individuals. However, for individuals with high-working-memory capacity, quantile dotplots evoke more accurate responses with less perceived effort. Given these results, we advocate for the inclusion of converging behavioral and subjective workload metrics in addition to accuracy performance to further disambiguate meaningful differences among visualization techniques.",

For example when the p-value is small enough or the CIs of the mean effects of a studied drug and a placebo are not overlapping, scientists tend to claim significant differences while often disregarding the magnitudes and absolute differences in the effect sizes. This type of reasoning has been shown to be potentially harmful to science. Techniques relying on the visual estimation of the strength of evidence have been recommended to reduce such dichotomous interpretations but their effectiveness has also been challenged. We ran two experiments on researchers with expertise in statistical analysis to compare several alternative representations of confidence intervals and used Bayesian multilevel models to estimate the effects of the representation styles on differences in researchers' subjective confidence in the results. We also asked the respondents' opinions and preferences in representation styles. Our results suggest that adding visual information to classic CI representation can decrease the tendency towards dichotomous interpretations - measured as the `cliff effect': the sudden drop in confidence around p-value 0.05 - compared with classic CI visualization and textual representation of the CI with p-values.

In a classic study in behavioral economics, Benartzi and Thaler (1999) found evidence using bar charts that investors exhibit myopic loss aversion in retirement decisions: Investors overly focus on the potential for short-term losses, leading them to invest less in riskier assets and miss out on higher long-term returns. Recently, advances in uncertainty visualizations have shown improvements in decision-making under uncertainty in a variety of tasks. In this paper, we conduct a controlled and incentivized crowdsourced experiment replicating Benartzi and Thaler (1999) and extending it to measure the effect of different uncertainty representations on myopic loss aversion. Consistent with the original study, we find evidence of myopic loss aversion with bar charts and find that participants make better investment decisions with longer evaluation periods. We also find that common uncertainty representations such as interval plots and bar charts achieve the highest mean expected returns while other uncertainty visualizations lead to poorer long-term performance and strong effects on the equity premium. Qualitative feedback further suggests that different uncertainty representations lead to visual reasoning heuristics that can either mitigate or encourage a focus on potential short-term losses. We discuss implications of our results on using uncertainty visualizations for retirement decisions in practice and possible extensions for future work.",

In these settings, an information provider chooses which information to provide to strategic agents and how to present it, and agents formulate a best response based on the information and their anticipation of how others will behave. We contribute the results of a controlled online experiment to examine how the provision and presentation of information impacts people's decisions in a congestion game. Our experiment compares how different visualization approaches for displaying this information, including bar charts and hypothetical outcome plots, and different information conditions, including where the visualized information is private versus public (i.e., available to all agents), affect decision making and welfare. We characterize the effects of visualization anticipation, referring to changes to behavior when an agent goes from alone having access to a visualization to knowing that others also have access to the visualization to guide their decisions. We also empirically identify the visualization equilibrium, i.e., the visualization for which the visualized outcome of agents' decisions matches the realized decisions of the agents who view it. We reflect on the implications of visualization equilibria and visualization anticipation for designing information displays for real-world strategic settings.",

Despite the enhanced performance and efficiency of HFL over local training, clues for inspecting the behaviors of the participating clients and the federated model are usually lacking due to the privacy-preserving nature of HFL. Consequently, the users can only conduct a shallow-level analysis of potential abnormal behaviors and have limited means to assess the contributions of individual clients and implement the necessary intervention. Visualization techniques have been introduced to facilitate the HFL process inspection, usually by providing model metrics and evaluation results as a dashboard representation. Although the existing visualization methods allow a simple examination of the HFL model performance, they cannot support the intensive exploration of the HFL process. In this study, strictly following the HFL privacy-preserving protocol, we design an exploratory visual analytics system for the HFL process termed HFLens, which supports comparative visual interpretation at the overview, communication round, and client instance levels. Specifically, the proposed system facilitates the investigation of the overall process involving all clients, the correlation analysis of clients' information in one or different communication round(s), the identification of potential anomalies, and the contribution assessment of each HFL client. Two case studies confirm the efficacy of our system. Experts' feedback suggests that our approach indeed helps in understanding and diagnosing the HFL process better.",

Though several formal frameworks have been proposed in response, we believe this issue persists because visualization recommendation algorithms are inadequately specified from an evaluation perspective. In this paper, we propose an evaluation-focused framework to contextualize and compare a broad range of visualization recommendation algorithms. We present the structure of our framework, where algorithms are specified using three components: (1) a graph representing the full space of possible visualization designs, (2) the method used to traverse the graph for potential candidates for recommendation, and (3) an oracle used to rank candidate designs. To demonstrate how our framework guides the formal comparison of algorithmic performance, we not only theoretically compare five existing representative recommendation algorithms, but also empirically compare four new algorithms generated based on our findings from the theoretical comparison. Our results show that these algorithms behave similarly in terms of user performance, highlighting the need for more rigorous formal comparisons of recommendation algorithms to further clarify their benefits in various analysis scenarios.",

In case of a violation, a counterexample that shows the erroneous behavior is returned. Understanding these counterexamples is challenging, especially for hyperproperty specifications, i.e., specifications that relate multiple executions of a system to each other. We aim to facilitate the visual analysis of such counterexamples through our HyperVis tool, which provides interactive visualizations of the given model, specification, and counterexample. Within an iterative and interdisciplinary design process, we developed visualization solutions that can effectively communicate the core aspects of the model checking result. Specifically, we introduce graphical representations of binary values for improving pattern recognition, color encoding for better indicating related aspects, visually enhanced textual descriptions, as well as extensive cross-view highlighting mechanisms. Further, through an underlying causal analysis of the counterexample, we are also able to identify values that contributed to the violation and use this knowledge for both improved encoding and highlighting. Finally, the analyst can modify both the specification of the hyperproperty and the system directly within HyperVis and initiate the model checking of the new version. In combination, these features notably support the analyst in understanding the error leading to the counterexample as well as iterating the provided system and specification. We ran multiple case studies with HyperVis and tested it with domain experts in qualitative feedback sessions. The participants' positive feedback confirms the considerable improvement over the manual, text-based status quo and the value of the tool for explaining hyperproperties.",

One of embComp\u2019s central features are overview visualizations that are based on metrics for measuring differences in the local structure around objects. Summarizing these local metrics over the embeddings provides global overviews of similarities and differences. Detail views allow comparison of the local structure around selected objects and relating this local information to the global views. Integrating and connecting all of these components, embComp supports a range of analysis workflows that help understand similarities and differences between embedding spaces. We assess our approach by applying it in several use cases, including understanding corpora differences via word vector embeddings, and understanding algorithmic differences in generating embeddings.",

Although many ML models perform promisingly, issues with model transparency and interpretability limit their adoption in clinical practice. Directly using existing explainable ML techniques in clinical settings can be challenging. Through literature surveys and collaborations with six clinicians with an average of 17 years of clinical experience, we identified three key challenges, including clinicians' unfamiliarity with ML features, lack of contextual information, and the need for cohort-level evidence. Following an iterative design process, we further designed and developed VBridge, a visual analytics tool that seamlessly incorporates ML explanations into clinicians' decision-making workflow. The system includes a novel hierarchical display of contribution-based feature explanations and enriched interactions that connect the dots between ML features, explanations, and data. We demonstrated the effectiveness of VBridge through two case studies and expert interviews with four clinicians, showing that visually associating model explanations with patients' situational records can help clinicians better interpret and use model predictions when making clinician decisions. We further derived a list of design implications for developing future explainable ML tools to support clinical decision-making.",

In interactive applications, the labeling method responsible for positioning the labels should not take the resources from the application itself. In other words, the labeling method should provide the result as fast as possible. In this work, we propose a greedy point-feature labeling method running on GPU. In contrast to existing methods that position the labels sequentially, the proposed method positions several labels in parallel. Yet, we guarantee that the positioned labels will not overlap, nor will they overlap important visual features. When the proposed method is searching for the label position of a point-feature, the available label candidates are evaluated with respect to overlaps with important visual features, conflicts with label candidates of other point-features, and their ambiguity. The evaluation of each label candidate is done in constant time independently from the number of point-features, the number of important visual features, and the resolution of the created image. Our measurements indicate that the proposed method is able to position more labels than existing greedy methods that do not evaluate conflicts between the label candidates. At the same time, the proposed method achieves a significant increase in performance. The increase in performance is mainly due to the parallelization and the efficient evaluation of label candidates.",

Because these attributes allow visualization creators to focus on design on implementation details, tools built on top of SVG, such as D3.js, are essential to the visualization community. However, slow SVG rendering can limit designs by effectively capping the number of on-screen data points, and this can force visualization creators to switch to Canvas or WebGL. These are less flexible (e.g., no search or styling via CSS), and harder to learn. We introduce Scalable Scalable Vector Graphics (SSVG) to reduce these limitations and allow complex and smooth visualizations to be created with SVG. SSVG automatically translates interactive SVG visualizations into a dynamic virtual DOM (VDOM) to bypass the browser's slow `to specification' rendering by intercepting JavaScript function calls. De-coupling the SVG visualization specification from SVG rendering, and obtaining a dynamic VDOM, creates flexibility and opportunity for visualization system research. SSVG uses this flexibility to free up the main thread for more interactivity and renders the visualization with Canvas or WebGL on a web worker. Together, these concepts create a drop-in JavaScript library which can improve rendering performance by 3-9X with only one line of code added. To demonstrate applicability, we describe the use of SSVG on multiple example visualizations including published visualization research.

Compute power is growing enormously and is enabling finely resolved simulations that produce never-before-seen features. However, I/O capabilities lag by orders of magnitude, which means only a fraction of the simulation data can be stored for post hoc analysis. Prespecified plans for saving features and quantities of interest do not work for features that have not been seen before. Data-driven intelligent sampling schemes are needed to detect and save important parts of the simulation while it is running. Here, we propose a novel sampling scheme that reduces the size of the data by orders-of-magnitude while still preserving important regions. The approach we develop selects points with unusual data values and high gradients. We demonstrate that our approach outperforms traditional sampling schemes on a number of tasks.",

While its run-time complexity limited it to small datasets in the past, recent efforts improved upon the expensive similarity computations and the previously quadratic minimization. Nevertheless, t-SNE still has high runtime and memory costs when operating on millions of points. We present a novel method for executing the t-SNE minimization. While our method overall retains a linear runtime complexity, we obtain a significant performance increase in the most expensive part of the minimization. We achieve a significant improvement without a noticeable decrease in accuracy even when targeting a 3D embedding. Our method constructs a pair of spatial hierarchies over the embedding, which are simultaneously traversed to approximate many N-body interactions at once. We demonstrate an efficient GPGPU implementation and evaluate its performance against state-of-the-art methods on a variety of datasets.",

Although t-SNE has been widely employed to visualize high-dimensional datasets from various domains, it is limited to projecting a single dataset. When a series of high-dimensional datasets, such as datasets changing over time, is projected independently using t-SNE, misaligned layouts are obtained. Even items with identical features across datasets are projected to different locations, making the technique unsuitable for comparison tasks. To tackle this problem, we introduce edge similarity, which captures the similarities between two adjacent time frames based on the Graphlet Frequency Distribution (GFD). We then integrate a novel loss term into the t-SNE loss function, which we call vector constraints, to preserve the vectors between projected points across the projections, allowing these points to serve as visual landmarks for direct comparisons between projections. Using synthetic datasets whose ground-truth structures are known, we show that Joint t-SNE outperforms existing techniques, including Dynamic t-SNE, in terms of local coherence error, Kullback-Leibler divergence, and neighborhood preservation. We also showcase a real-world use case to visualize and compare the activation of different layers of a neural network.",

At the core of our algorithm is a set of objective functions motivated by a number of design principles that we have identified. These objective functions are then used in an optimization framework that we develop to achieve high-quality layouts. Recognizing the duality between entities and relationships in the data, we provide a second visualization in which the roles of entities and relationships in the original data are reversed. This can lead to additional insight about the data. Furthermore, we enhance our framework for a joint optimization on the primal layout (original data) and the dual layout (where the roles of entities and relationships are reversed). This allows users to inspect their data using two complementary views. We apply our visualization approach to a number of datasets that include co-authorship data and social contact pattern data.",

To fill this gap, we designed and implemented ThreadStates, an interactive visual analytics tool for the exploration of longitudinal patient cohort data. The focus of ThreadStatesis to identify the states of disease progression by learning from observation data in a human-in-the-loop manner. We propose a novel Glyph Matrix design and combine it with a scatter plot to enable seamless identification, observation, and refinement of states. The disease progression patterns are then revealed in terms of state transitions using Sankey-based visualizations. We employ sequence clustering techniques to find patient groups with distinctive progression patterns, and to reveal the association between disease progression and patient-level features. The design and development were driven by a requirement analysis and iteratively refined based on feedback from domain experts over the course of a 10-month design study. Case studies and expert interviews demonstrate that ThreadStates can successively summarize disease states, reveal disease progression, and compare patient groups.",

This is a question a new microscopy-based approach for measuring the mass of individual cancer cells treated with different drugs promises to answer in only a few hours. However, the analysis pipeline for extracting data from these images is still far from complete automation: human intervention is necessary for quality control for preprocessing steps such as segmentation, to adjust filters, and remove noise, and for the analysis of the result. To address this workflow, we developed Loon, a visualization tool for analyzing drug screening data based on quantitative phase microscopy imaging. Loon visualizes both derived data such as growth rates, and imaging data. Since the images are collected automatically at a large scale, manual inspection of images and segmentations is infeasible. However, reviewing representative samples of cells is essential, both for quality control and for data analysis. We introduce a new approach of choosing and visualizing representative exemplar cells that retain a close connection to the low-level data. By tightly integrating the derived data visualization capabilities with the novel exemplar visualization and providing selection and filtering capabilities, Loon is well suited for making decisions about which drugs are suitable for a specific patient.",

However, a substantial gap remains with respect to visualizing the resulting multivariate image data and effectively supporting pathology workflows in digital environments on screen. We, therefore, developed Scope2Screen, a scalable software system for focus+context exploration and annotation of whole-slide, high-plex, tissue images. Our approach scales to analyzing 100GB images of 10^9 or more pixels per channel, containing millions of individual cells. A multidisciplinary team of visualization experts, microscopists, and pathologists identified key image exploration and annotation tasks involving finding, magnifying, quantifying, and organizing regions of interest (ROIs) in an intuitive and cohesive manner. Building on a scope-to-screen metaphor, we present interactive lensing techniques that operate at single-cell and tissue levels. Lenses are equipped with task-specific functionality and descriptive statistics, making it possible to analyze image features, cell types, and spatial arrangements (neighborhoods) across image channels and scales. A fast sliding-window search guides users to regions similar to those under the lens; these regions can be analyzed and considered either separately or as part of a larger image collection. A novel snapshot method enables linked lens configurations and image statistics to be saved, restored, and shared with these regions. We validate our designs with domain experts and apply Scope2Screen in two case studies involving lung and colorectal cancers to discover cancer-relevant image features.",

The DNA's extremely long sequential structure---arranged differently on several distinct scale levels---is often lost in traditional 3D depictions, mainly due to its multiple levels of dense spatial packing and the resulting occlusion. Furthermore, interactive exploration of this complex structure is cumbersome, requiring visibility management like cut-aways. In contrast to existing temporally controlled multiscale data exploration, we allow viewers to always see and interact with any of the involved scales. For this purpose we separate the depiction into constant-scale and scale transition zones. Constant-scale zones maintain a single-scale representation, while still linearly unfolding the DNA. Inspired by illustration, scale transition zones connect adjacent constant-scale zones via level unfolding, scaling, and transparency. We thus represent the spatial structure of the whole DNA macro-molecule, maintain its local organizational characteristics, linearize its higher-level organization, and use spatially controlled, understandable interpolation between neighboring scales. We also contribute interaction techniques that provide viewers with a coarse-to-fine control for navigating within our all-scales-in-one-view representations and visual aids to illustrate the size differences. Overall, Multiscale Unfolding allows viewers to grasp the DNA's structural composition from chromosomes to the atoms, with increasing levels of \"unfoldedness,\" and can be applied in data-driven illustration and communication.",

While location is at the heart of many data questions, geographic location can be difficult to specify in natural language (NL) queries. This is especially true when working with fuzzy cognitive regions or regions that may be defined based on data distributions instead of absolute administrative location (e.g., state, country). GeoSneakPique presents a novel method for using a mapping widget to support the NL query process, allowing users to specify location via direct manipulation with data-driven guidance on spatial distributions to help select the area of interest. Users receive feedback to help them evaluate and refine their spatial selection interactively and can save spatial definitions for re-use in subsequent queries. We conduct a qualitative evaluation of the GeoSneakPique that indicates the usefulness of the interface as well as opportunities for better supporting geospatial workflows in visual analysis tasks employing cognitive regions.",

Unlike most visualization grammars which use declarative specifications to describe visualization components, Atlas exposes the generative process of a visualization through a set of concatenated high-level production rules. These rules define how graphical objects are created, transformed and coupled with abstract data. The input and output of each rule is clearly defined, allowing inspection of visualization states throughout the generative process. We demonstrate Atlas\u2019 expressiveness through a catalog of more than 40 visualization designs, and its extensibility through a case study of area-based visualizations.",

This free-form medium has a long history and has been used as means for personal or intimate expression, as a way for marginalized people to describe issues that are important to them, and as a venue for graphical experimentation. It would seem then that zines would make an ideal vehicle for the recent interest in applying feminist or humanist ideas to visualization. Yet, there has been little work combining visualization and zines. In this paper we explore the potential of this intersection by analyzing examples of zines that use data graphics and by describing the pedagogical value that they can have in a visualization classroom. In doing so, we argue that there are plentiful opportunities for visualization research and practice in this rich intersectional-medium.",

Our main contribution is an analysis of how analysts construct narrative maps. The insights extracted from our study can be used to design narrative map visualizations, extraction algorithms, and visual analytics tools to support the sensemaking process.",

We manually coded each sketch against 12 metrics related to visual encodings, representations, and story structure. We find evidence for preferential use of positional and shape-based encodings, a wide variety of mixed symbolic and textual representations, and a high prevalence of stories comparing subsets of data. These findings contribute to our understanding of how learners sketch with data. They can inform tool design for learners, and help create educational programs that introduce novices to sketching practices from the field.",

However, effective staging requires careful attention to both animation semantics and timing parameters. We present Gemini\u00b2, a system for creating staged animations from a sequence of chart keyframes. Given only a start state and an end state, Gemini\u00b2 can automatically recommend intermediate keyframes for designers to consider. The Gemini\u00b2 recommendation engine leverages Gemini, our prior work, and GraphScape to itemize the given complex change into semantic edit operations and to recombine operations into stages with a guided order for clearly conveying the semantics. To evaluate Gemini\u00b2\u2019s recommendations, we conducted a human-subject study in which participants ranked recommended animations from both Gemini\u00b2 and Gemini. We find that Gemini\u00b2\u2019s animation recommendation ranking is well aligned with subjects\u2019 preferences, and Gemini\u00b2 can recommend favorable animations that Gemini cannot support.",

Rule sets are typically presented as a text-based list of logical statements (rules). Surprisingly, to date there has been limited work on exploring visual alternatives for presenting rules. In this paper, we explore the idea of designing alternative representations of rules, focusing on a number of visual factors we believe have a positive impact on rule readability and understanding. We then presents a user study exploring their impact. The results show that some design factors have a strong impact on how efficiently readers can process the rules while having minimal impact on accuracy. This work can help practitioners employ more effective solutions when using rules as a communication strategy to understand ML models.",

Our research team previously developed a new structured process for such users to assess AI, called After-Action Review for AI (AAR/AI), consisting of a series of steps a human takes to assess an AI agent and formalize their understanding. In this paper, we investigate how the AAR/AI process can scale up to support reinforcement learning (RL) agents that operate in complex environments. We augment the AAR/AI process to be performed at three levels--episode-level, decision-level, and explanation-level--and integrate it into our redesigned visual analytics interface. We illustrate our approach through a usage scenario of analyzing why a RL agent lost in a complex real-time strategy game built with the StarCraft 2 engine. We believe integrating structured processes like AAR/AI into visualization tools can help visualization play a more critical role in AI interpretability.",

In this paper we introduce AdViCE, a visual analytics tool that aims to guide users in black-box model debugging and validation. The solution rests on two main visual user interface innovations: (1) an interactive visualization design that enables the comparison of decisions on user-defined data subsets; (2) an algorithm and visual design to compute and visualize counterfactual explanations - explanations that depict model outcomes when data features are perturbed from their original values. Furthermore, we provide an evaluation of the work through a number of use cases that demonstrate the capabilities and potential limitations of the proposed approach.",

However, detecting covariate shift is challenging, especially when the data is high-dimensional images, and when multiple types of localized covariate shift affect different subspaces of the data. Although automated techniques can be used to detect the existence of covariate shift, our goal is to help human users characterize the extent of covariate shift in large image datasets with visual interfaces that seamlessly integrate information obtained from the detection algorithms. In this paper, we design and evaluate a new visual analytics approach that facilitates the comparison of the local distributions of training and test data. We conduct a quantitative user study on multi-attribute facial data to compare two different learned low-dimensional latent representations (pretrained ImageNet CNN vs. density ratio) and two user analytic workflows (nearest-neighbor vs. cluster-to-cluster). Our results indicate that the latent representation of our density ratio model, combined with a nearest-neighbor comparison, is the most effective at helping humans identify covariate shift.",

A qualitative evaluation of the prototype that implemented the algorithm indicates that the generalized line charts pre-served the general data shape, while minimizing visual clutter. We identify future opportunities where generalization can be extended and applied to other chart types and visual analysis authoring tools.",

However, successfully reading and interpreting the data shown in an alluvial diagram is likely influenced by factors such as data volume, complexity, and chart layout. To understand how alluvial diagram consumption is impacted by its visual features, we conduct two crowdsourced user studies with a set of alluvial diagrams of varying complexity, and examine (i) participant performance on analysis tasks, and (ii) the perceived complexity of the charts. Using the study results, we employ Bayesian modelling to predict participant classification of diagram complexity. We find that, while multiple visual features are important in contributing to alluvial diagram complexity, interestingly the most important feature changes depending on the type of complexity being modeled, i.e. task complexity vs. perceived complexity.",

A crucial step of this process is to inspect the model's accuracy and decide whether it is necessary to label additional elements. In scenarios with no or very little labeled data, visual inspection of the predictions is required. Similarity-preserving scatterplots created through a dimensionality reduction algorithm are a common visualization that is used in these cases. Previous studies investigated the effects of layout and image complexity on tasks like labeling. However, model evaluation has not been studied systematically. We present the results of an experiment studying the influence of image complexity and visual grouping of images on model accuracy estimation. We found that users outperform traditional automated approaches when estimating a model's accuracy. Furthermore, while the complexity of images impacts the overall performance, the layout of the items in the plot has little to no effect on estimations.",

By comparing our study results with the outcomes of existing mathematical models for histogram binning (e.g., Sturges\u2019 formula, Scott\u2019s normal reference rule, the Rice Rule, or Freedman\u2013Diaconis\u2019 choice), we can see that most of them overestimate the number of bins necessary to make the distribution visible to a human viewer.",

However, due to a large number of possible control combinations and the complexity of WDS simulations, it remains non-trivial to identify the best pump controls by reviewing the simulation results. To address this problem, we design a visual analytics system that helps understand relationships between simulation inputs and outputs towards better optimization. Our system incorporates interpretable machine learning as well as multiple linked visualizations to capture essential input-output relationships from complex WDS simulations. We demonstrate our system's effectiveness through a practical case study and evaluate its usability through expert reviews.

Installation and managing new versions has been challenging and time-consuming, historically, for CellProfiler Analyst. CPAW is an alternative that ensures installation and future updates are not a hassle to the user. CPAW ports the core iteration loop of CPA to a pure server-less browser environment using modern web-development technologies, allowing computationally heavy activities, like machine learning, to occur without freezing the UI. With a setup as simple as navigating to a website, CPAW presents a clean user interface to the user to refine their classifier and explore phenotypic data with ease. We evaluated both the old and the new version of the software in an extensive domain expert study. We found that users could complete the essential classification tasks in CPAW and CPA 3.0 with the same efficiency. Additionally, users completed the tasks 20 percent faster using CPAW compared to CPA 3.0.\nThe code of CellProfiler Analyst Web is open-source and available at \\url{https://mpsych.github.io/CellProfilerAnalystWeb/",

To give a more general overview of the data, we extend Fuzzy Contour Trees, from the visualization and simultaneous analysis of the topology of multiple scalar fields, to time dependent scalar fields. The resulting time-varying Fuzzy Contour Trees allow the comparison of multiple time steps that are not required to be consecutive. We provide specific interaction and navigation possibilities that allow the exploration of individual time steps and time windows in addition to the behavior of the contour trees over all time steps. To achieve this, we reduce an existing alignment to multiple sub-alignments and adapt the Fuzzy Contour Tree-layout to continuously reflect changes and similarities in the sub-alignments. We apply time-varying Fuzzy Contour Trees to different real-world data sets and demonstrate their usefulness.",

However, existing tet marching techniques do not easily generalize to rays with arbitrary origin and direction required for advanced shading effects or non-convex meshes. Additionally, the memory footprint of these methods may exceed GPU memory limits. Interactive performance and high image quality are opposing goals. Our approach significantly lowers the burden to render unstructured datasets with high image fidelity while maintaining real-time and interactive performance even for large datasets. To this end, we leverage hardware-accelerated ray tracing to find entry and exit faces for a given ray into a volume and utilize a compact mesh representation to enable the efficient marching of arbitrary rays, thus allowing for advanced shading effects that ultimately yields more convincing and grounded images. Our approach is also robust, supporting both convex and non-convex unstructured meshes. We show that our method achieves interactive rates even with moderately-sized datasets while secondary effects are applied.",

Their study plays an important role in the design of novel materials. A common yet challenging task in the study is to determine the nature of those electronic transitions, i.e. which subgroups of the molecule are involved in the transition by donating or accepting electrons, followed by an investigation of the variation in the donor-acceptor behavior for different transitions or conformations of the molecules. In this paper, we present a novel approach towards the study of electronic transitions based on the visual analysis of a bivariate field, namely the electron density in the hole and particle Natural Transition Orbital (NTO). The visual analysis focuses on the continuous scatter plots (CSPs) of the bivariate field linked to their spatial domain. The method supports selections in the CSP visualized as fiber surfaces in the spatial domain, the grouping of atoms, and segmentation of the density fields to peel the CSP. This peeling operator is central to the visual analysis process and helps identify donors and acceptors. We study different molecular systems, identifying local excitation and charge transfer excitations to demonstrate the utility of the method.",

In this paper, we address the challenge of uncertainty visualization of the topology cases of the MS and MC algorithms for uncertain scalar field data sampled on a uniform grid. The visualization of the MS and MC topology cases for uncertain data is challenging due to their exponential nature and a possibility of multiple topology cases per cell of a grid. We propose the topology case count and entropy-based techniques for quantifying uncertainty in the topology cases of the MS and MC algorithms when noise in data is modeled with probability distributions. We demonstrate the applicability of our techniques for independent and correlated uncertainty assumptions. We visualize the quantified topological uncertainty via color mapping proportional to uncertainty, as well as with interactive probability queries in the MS case and entropy isosurfaces in the MC case. We demonstrate the utility of our uncertainty quantification framework in identifying the isovalues exhibiting relatively high topological uncertainty. We illustrate the effectiveness of our techniques via results on synthetic, simulation, and hixel datasets.",

However, they visualize state changes as either slope or difference of bars, which has been proved less effective for quantitative comparison. Also, both visual designs suffer from visual clutter issues with an increasing number of data items. In this paper, we propose Intercept Grpah, a novel visual design to facilitate effective interactive comparison of state changes. Specifically, a radial design is proposed to visualize the starting and ending states of each data item on two concentric circles and the chord length explicitly encodes the \"state change''. By interactively adjusting the inner circle radius, Intercept Grpah can smoothly filter out the large state changes and magnify the difference between similar state changes, mitigating the visual clutter issues and enhancing the effective comparison of state changes. We conducted case studies through comparing Intercept Grpah with slope graphs and grouped bar charts on real datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of Intercept Grpah.",

As the data changes, the y-axis may need to be rescaled as the domain of the data changes. Each axis rescaling potentially improves the readability of the current chart, but may also disorient the user. In contrast to static visualizations, where there is considerable literature to help choose the appropriate y-axis scale, there is a lack of guidance about how and when rescaling should be used in dynamic visualizations. Existing visualization systems and libraries adapt a fixed global y-axis, or rescale every time the data changes. Yet, professional visualizations, such as in data journalism, do not adopt either strategy.They instead carefully and manually choose when to rescale based on the analysis task and data. To this end, we conduct a series of Mechanical Turk experiments to study the potential of dynamic axis rescaling, the factors that affect its effectiveness. We find that the appropriate rescaling policy is both task- and data-dependent, and we do not find one clear policy choice for all situations.",

Usually, it is also hard to understand initially if the fundamental problem is in the model performance or if there are data issues that are causing problems in the evaluation. With this in mind, we developed a visualization system that would allow the users to quickly identify and diagnose issues with current model deployment, from model performance to data issues that prevent accurate evaluation of the model. Our application enables our security data science team to have a situational awareness of the system and quickly investigate any problems. While designing our system, we considered all the common issues we see in production. In this paper, we will describe this application, its regular usage, and some of the special example cases when it was proved valuable for introspecting our models.",

An effective solution to this problem is to employ provable privacy techniques, such as differential privacy, to add noise to the statistics before releasing them. This protection lowers the risk of sharing sensitive data with more or less trusted data sharing partners. Unfortunately, applying differential privacy in its mathematical form requires one to fix certain numeric parameters, which involves subtle computations and expert knowledge that the data owners may lack.",

State-of-the-art approaches for AG generation focus mostly on deriving dependencies between system vulnerabilities based on network scans and expert knowledge. In real-world operations however, it is costly and ineffective to rely on constant vulnerability scanning and expert-crafted AGs. We propose to automatically learn AGs based on actions observed through intrusion alerts, without prior expert knowledge. Specifically, we develop an unsupervised sequence learning system, SAGE, that leverages the temporal and probabilistic dependence between alerts in a suffix-based probabilistic deterministic finite automaton(S-PDFA) \u2013 a model that accentuates infrequent severe alerts and summarizes paths leading to them. AGs are then derived from the S-PDFA. Tested with intrusion alerts collected through Collegiate Penetration Testing Competition, SAGE compresses several thousands of alerts into only a handful of AGs. These AGs reflect the strategies used by participating teams. The resulting AGs are succinct, interpretable, and enable analysts to derive actionable insights, e.g., attackers tend to follow shorter paths after they have discovered a longer one.",

State-of-the-art approaches for AG generation focus mostly on deriving dependencies between system vulnerabilities based on network scans and expert knowledge. In real-world operations however, it is costly and ineffective to rely on constant vulnerability scanning and expert-crafted AGs. We propose to automatically learn AGs based on actions observed through intrusion alerts, without prior expert knowledge. Specifically, we develop an unsupervised sequence learning system, SAGE, that leverages the temporal and probabilistic dependence between alerts in a suffix-based probabilistic deterministic finite automaton(S-PDFA) \u2013 a model that accentuates infrequent severe alerts and summarizes paths leading to them. AGs are then derived from the S-PDFA. Tested with intrusion alerts collected through Collegiate Penetration Testing Competition, SAGE compresses several thousands of alerts into only a handful of AGs. These AGs reflect the strategies used by participating teams. The resulting AGs are succinct, interpretable, and enable analysts to derive actionable insights, e.g., attackers tend to follow shorter paths after they have discovered a longer one.",

Newly proliferating and frequently applied types of malware (e.g., fileless malware) increase the need to conduct digital forensic investigations in real-time. In the course of these investigations, forensic experts are confronted with a wide range of different forensic tools. The decision, which of those are suitable for the current situation, is often based on the forensic experts' experience. Currently, there is no reliable automated solution to support this decision-making. Therefore, we derive requirements for visually supporting the decision-making process for live forensic investigations and introduce a research prototype that provides visual guidance for cyber forensic experts during a live digital forensic investigation. Our prototype collects relevant core information for a live digital forensic and provides visual representations for connections between occurring events, developments over time, and detailed information on specific events. To show the applicability of our approach, we analyze an exemplary use case using the prototype and demonstrate the support through our approach.",

Automatic software scanners enable developers to analyze their applications to detect vulnerabilities and alert them of their presence. But often these reports are hard to understand, include false positives or overwhelm users due to the sheer number of alerts, since a report may contain hundreds to thousands of vulnerabilities. Developers must undergo a process called vulnerability triage to find the relevant vulnerabilities to fix. This paper presents two interactive visualizations for developers and security experts to gain an overview of the security state of their application. Users can see the distribution of vulnerabilities, find the most relevant ones, and compare differences between application versions. Our visualization design is inspired by an initial preliminary study and has been evaluated by domain experts to investigate the usability and appropriateness.",

In this design study, we propose VulnEx (Vulnerability Explorer), a tool to audit entire software development organizations. We introduce three complementary table-based representations to identify and assess vulnerability exposures due to OSS, which we designed in collaboration with security analysts. The presented tool allows examining problematic projects and applications (repositories), third-party libraries, and vulnerabilities across a software organization. We show the applicability of our tool through a use case and preliminary expert feedback.",

This article proposes a conceptual framework to examine how physicalizations relate to data. This article develops a two-dimensional conceptual space for comparing different perspectives on data used in physicalization, drawing from design theory and critical data studies literature. One axis distinguishes between epistemological and ontological perspectives, focusing on the relationship between data and the mind. The second axis distinguishes how data relate to the world, differentiating between representational and relational perspectives. To clarify the aesthetic and conceptual implications of these different perspectives, the article discusses examples of data physicalization for each quadrant of the continuous space. It further uses the framework to examine the explicit and implicit assumptions about data in physicalization literature. As a theoretical article, it encourages practitioners to think about how data relate to the manifestations and the phenomena they try to capture. It invites exploration of the relationship between data and the world as a generative source of creative tension.",

As our modular and intuitive design approach allows the construction to occur as a shared, collective activity, Data Badges take advantage of the creative, affective, and social values that underlie physicalization and its construction to engage participants in reflecting on personal data.

To evaluate Move&Find, we operationalized a framework suitable to evaluate the value of data representations in casual contexts and experimentally compared Move&Find to a corresponding visualization.

Our research uses a participatory approach to research-through-design and includes two interdependent studies. In the first, personalized data physicalizations are developed for three individuals. In the second, we conduct a parallel autobiographical exploration of what constitutes personal data when using a Fitbit. Our work expands the landscape of data physicalization by introducing narrative physicalizations.

Data physicalization may be a useful tool for these communications, because it is thought to be accessible to a general audience and emotionally engaged. However, there are limited studies of data physicalization in the wild with diverse communities. Our application of this method in the Green Housing Study is an early example of using data physicalization in environmental health report-back. We gathered feedback through community meetings, prototype testing, and semistructured interviews, leading to the development of data t-shirts and other garments and person-sized bar charts. We found that participants were enthusiastic about data physicalizations, it connected them to their previous experience, and they had varying desires to share their data. Our findings suggest that researchers can enhance environmental communications by further developing the human experience of physicalizations and engaging diverse communities.",

In the case of the latter audience-which has become increasingly concerned with the implications of climate change for society-there is a requirement for visualizations which are compelling and engaging. We describe the use of ParaView, a well-established visualization application, to produce images and animations of results from a large set of modeling experiments, and their use in the promulgation of climate research results. Visualization can also make useful contributions to development, particularly for complex large-scale applications such as climate models. We present early results from the construction of a next-generation climate model which has been designed for use on exascale compute platforms, and show how visualization has helped in the development process, particularly with regard to higher model resolutions and novel data representations.",

Yet, they also easily overwhelm visitors due to their perceptual richness and associated information. Similarly, digitized collections appear as complex, multifaceted phenomena, which can be challenging to grasp and navigate. Though visualizations can create various types of collection overviews for that matter, they do not easily assemble into a \u201cbig picture\u201d or lead to an integrated understanding. We introduce coherence techniques to maximize connections between multiple views and apply them to the prototype PolyCube system of collection visualization: with map, set, and network visualizations it makes spatial, categorical, and relational collection aspects visible. For the essential temporal dimension, it offers four different views: superimposition, animation, juxtaposition, and space-time cube representations. A user study confirmed that better integrated visualizations support synoptic, cross-dimensional insights. An outlook is dedicated to the system's applicability within other arts and humanities data domains.",

We propose CLEVis, a neighborhood visual analytics system for CLE datasets, to help frontline users explore events for insights at community regions of interest, namely fine-grained geographical resolutions, such as small neighborhoods around local restaurants, churches, and schools. CLEVis fully utilizes semantic information by integrating automatic algorithms and interactive visualizations. The design and development of CLEVis are conducted with solid collaborations with real-world community workers and social scientists. Case studies and user feedback are presented with real-world datasets and applications.",

                        "abstract": "When adding a photo onto a graphic design, professional graphic designers often adjust its colors based on some target colors obtained from the brand or product to make the entire design more memorable to audiences and establish a consistent brand identity. However, adjusting the colors of a photo in the context of a graphic design is a difficult task, with two major challenges: (1) Locality: The color is often adjusted locally to preserve the semantics and atmosphere of the original image; and (2) Naturalness: The modified region needs to be carefully chosen and recolored to obtain a semantically valid and visually natural result. To address these challenges, we propose a learning-based approach to photo color adjustment for graphic designs, which maps an input photo along with the target colors to a recolored result. Our method decomposes the color adjustment process into two successive stages: modifiable region selection and target color propagation. The first stage aims to solve the core, challenging problem of which local image region(s) should be adjusted, which requires not only a common sense of colors appearing in our visual world but also understanding of subtle visual design heuristics. To this end, we capitalize on both natural photos and graphic designs to train a region selection network, which detects the most likely regions to be adjusted to the target colors. The second stage trains a recoloring network to naturally propagate the target colors in the detected regions. Through extensive experiments and a user study, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our selective region-based photo recoloring framework.",

However, this assumption is not well assessed due to the difficulty in collecting and registering freehand drawings. Alternatively, tracings are easier to collect and register, but there is no quantitative evaluation of tracing as a proxy for freehand drawing. In this paper, we compare tracing, freehand drawing, and computer-generated drawing approximation (CGDA) to understand their similarities and differences. We collected a dataset of 1,498 tracings and freehand drawings by 110 participants for 100 image prompts. Our drawings are registered to the prompts and include vector-based timestamped strokes collected via stylus input. Comparing tracing and freehand drawing, we found a high degree of similarity in stroke placement and types of strokes used over time. We show that tracing can serve as a viable proxy for freehand drawing because of similar correlations between spatio-temporal stroke features and labeled stroke types. Comparing hand-drawn content and current CGDA output, we found that 60% of drawn pixels corresponded to computer-generated pixels on average. The overlap tended to be commonly drawn content, but people's artistic choices and temporal tendencies remained largely uncaptured. We present an initial analysis to inform new CGDA algorithms and drawing applications, and provide the dataset for use by the community.",

                        "abstract": "We introduce a novel transmittance model to improve the volumetric representation of 3D scenes. The model can represent opaque surfaces in the volumetric light transport framework. Volumetric representations are useful for complex scenes, and become increasingly popular for level of detail and scene reconstruction. The traditional exponential transmittance model found in volumetric light transport cannot capture correlations in visibility across volume elements. When representing opaque surfaces as volumetric density, this leads to both bloating of silhouettes and light leaking artifacts. By introducing a parametric non-exponential transmittance model, we are able to approximate these correlation effects and significantly improve the accuracy of volumetric appearance representation of opaque scenes. Our parametric transmittance model can represent a continuum between the linear transmittance that opaque surfaces exhibit and the traditional exponential transmittance encountered in participating media and unstructured geometries. This covers a large part of the spectrum of geometric structures encountered in complex scenes. In order to handle the spatially varying transmittance correlation effects, we further extend the theory of non-exponential participating media to a heterogeneous transmittance model. Our model is compact in storage and computationally efficient both for evaluation and for reverse-mode gradient computation. Applying our model to optimization algorithms yields significant improvements in volumetric scene appearance quality. We further show improvements for relevant applications, such as scene appearance prefiltering, image-based scene reconstruction using differentiable rendering, neural representations, and compare it to a conventional exponential model.",

                        "abstract": "Generating free-viewpoint videos is critical for immersive VR/AR experience but recent neural advances still lack the editing ability to manipulate the visual perception for large dynamic scenes. To fill this gap, in this paper we propose the first approach for editable photo-realistic free-viewpoint video generation for large-scale dynamic scenes using only sparse 16 cameras. The core of our approach is a new layered neural representation, where each dynamic entity including the environment itself is formulated into a space-time coherent neural layered radiance representation called ST-NeRF. Such layered representation supports fully perception and realistic manipulation of the dynamic scene whilst still supporting a free viewing experience in a wide range. In our ST-NeRF, the dynamic entity/layer is represented as continuous functions, which achieves the disentanglement of location, deformation as well as the appearance of the dynamic entity in a continuous and self-supervised manner. We propose a scene parsing 4D label map tracking to disentangle the spatial information explicitly, and a continuous deform module to disentangle the temporal motion implicitly. An object-aware volume rendering scheme is further introduced for the re-assembling of all the neural layers. We adopt a novel layered loss and motion-aware ray sampling strategy to enable efficient training for a large dynamic scene with multiple performers, Our framework further enables a variety of editing functions, i.e., manipulating the scale and location, duplicating or retiming individual neural layers to create numerous visual effects while preserving high realism. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach to achieve high-quality, photo-realistic, and editable free-viewpoint video generation for dynamic scenes.",

                        "abstract": "Manufactured parts are meticulously engineered to perform well with respect to several conflicting metrics, like weight, stress, and cost. The best achievable trade-offs reside on the Pareto front which can be discovered via performance-driven optimization. The objectives that define this Pareto front often incorporate assumptions about the context in which a part will be used, including loading conditions, environmental influences, material properties, or regions that must be preserved to interface with a surrounding assembly. Existing multi-objective optimization tools are only equipped to study one context at a time, so engineers must run independent optimizations for each context of interest. However, engineered parts frequently appear in many contexts: wind turbines must perform well in many wind speeds, and a bracket might be optimized several times with its bolt-holes fixed in different locations on each run. In this paper, we formulate a framework for variable-context multi-objective optimization. We introduce the Pareto gamut, which captures Pareto fronts over a range of contexts. We develop a global/local optimization algorithm to discover the Pareto gamut directly, rather than discovering a single fixed-context \"slice\" at a time. To validate our method, we adapt existing multi-objective optimization benchmarks to contextual scenarios. We also demonstrate the practical utility of Pareto gamut exploration for several engineering design problems.",

Classical prefiltering (mipmapping) methods work well on simple material properties such as diffuse color, but fail to generalize to normals, self-shadowing, fibers or more complex microstructures and reflectances. In this work, we generalize traditional mipmap pyramids to pyramids of neural textures, combined with a fully connected network. We also introduce neural offsets, a novel method which allows rendering materials with intricate parallax effects without any tessellation. This generalizes classical parallax mapping, but is trained without supervision by any explicit heightfield. Neural materials within our system support a 7-dimensional query, including position, incoming and outgoing direction, and the desired filter kernel size. The materials have small storage (on the order of standard mipmapping except with more texture channels), and can be integrated within common Monte-Carlo path tracing systems. We demonstrate our method on a variety of materials, resulting in complex appearance across levels of detail, with accurate parallax, self-shadowing, and other effects.",
