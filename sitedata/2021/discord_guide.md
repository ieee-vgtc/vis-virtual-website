# IEEE VIS 2020 Discord Guide

Discord is a chat platform similar to Slack or IRC. The server contains a set
of channels, which can be grouped into categories. These are shown in
the UI panel to the left, as in the picture below.

**Figure 1:** Discord's User Interface. Channels are shown to the
left, those with a \# icon (a) are text channels, those with a speaker
icon (b) are voice chat channels. Users on the server are shown to the
left. (c) Channels are grouped into categories. (d) The
microphone icone is used to mute or unmute yourself, the headset icon is
used to deafen (silence incoming voice chat) or undeafen yourself. (e)
is the input for the chat.

## Channels for Conference Tracks

A channel is created for each conference track (named after famous
New Orleans streets) that will be the same throughout the week. 
While viewing a session in the virtual website, the track's channel
will automatically be shown.

## Navigation

Select the channel you want to join in the channels list. You can
minimize categories you don't want to see by clicking the toggle arrow
to the left of the category name (c). If you have unread messages in the
category, those channels won't be hidden. To hide a category with unread
messages you can right click it, as shown in Figure 2, and select mute
for the period you want.
