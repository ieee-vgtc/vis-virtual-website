Cartoons and animation domain videos have very different characteristics compared to real-life images and videos. In addition, this domain carries a large variability in styles. Using mappings defined by computer vision algorithms may fail on animated content because they were trained on natural images. In a recent paper [1] we presented a method to refine a semantic representation to be suitable for specific animated content. This representation allows building dictionaries of the cast of characters in an animation videos, and defining specialized classifiers for specific stylistic content, that are then used to automatically label all characters in an animation videos. Furthermore, as we demonstrate in this poster, it also allows to visualize both local and global aspects of the animation in a manner that was not possible without CAST.",

This paper presents an evaluation with 6 experts, 4 cardiothoracic surgeons, and 2 cardiologists, from Children\u2019s Healthcare of Atlanta (CHOA) Heart Center to validate the usability and technical innovations of CardiacAR, a prototype mobile AR surgical planning application.

The area where the attention is concentrated is called AoIs (Area of Interests) and contains semantical information. However, the semantics of AoIs is focused on analyzing the attention shift between AoIs. In addition, since the conventional fixation and saccade identification algorithms rely on raw eye movement data, fixation is usually located at a position independent of the visual stimulus. In this paper, we propose the fixation identification algorithm based on the segmented object and velocity-threshold. We determine the gaze target object with the segmented object and the foveal area range. Our algorithm utilizes the target object and velocity-threshold for fixation identification and positioning.",

Though these personal health-tracking devices are good in presenting physiological health data (quantified data) such as blood pressure, heart rate or blood glucose level, they fall short in integrating experiential subjective data like emotions, lifestyle and social interactions for richer contextual information. We introduce \"Healthy Me\", a personal visual health data journaling application to explore whether the combination of subjective measures and the quantified self-technologies can help a person develop their own digital wellbeing stories as well as enhancing the dialogue between health providers. We carried out a qualitative study with both patient participants and healthcare professionals. Our results, while preliminary, reveal that seeing the subjective metrics along with their physiological health data can help patients and practitioners reason about their behaviors. The feedback from the study suggests that such approaches provoke more self-awareness and curiosity among patients around healthier choices and can serve as a good educational tool for health practitioners to converse with their patients.",

        "abstract": "When sharing visualizations, annotations provide valuable insights into the data by focusing attention on important visual elements. As a result, annotations have become an essential part of visualizations, primarily when externalizing data or engaging in collaborative analysis. Therefore, it is crucial to understand how people annotate visualizations. This study investigates how visualization students annotate bar charts when asked to answer high-level questions about the data in the charts. The resulting annotations were coded and summarized into a taxonomy with several interesting findings. For example, we notice that several annotation types were broadly applied, while others were just used in special cases. In addition, we found ensembles of annotations were required to sufficiently annotate some tasks. Our findings provide an early framework for contextualizing the usage of annotations, further providing guidance for best practice uses.",

        "abstract": "Prior work has shown that it can be difficult to navigate a large volume of social annotations and that establishing diverse discussions remains a challenge, particularly in university classroom settings. To address this, we developed a prototype social annotation tool that displays interactive visualizations of annotation threads. The visualizations included: 1) a bar chart that displays the counts of different categories of comments, 2) a sentiment axis that shows the sentiment distribution, and 3) a key term frequency list that displays the most frequent terms in the comments. In a user study, we found that users who interacted with the visualizations explored more annotation threads and created more comments, although the diversity of categories of comments created did not change. Our results provide design insights and inspire future research directions on the roles of interactive visualizations on social annotation data.",

        "abstract": "Trust plays a significant role in how people perceive, discount, or dismiss scientific information and make critical decisions. Therefore, establishing trust is a critical first step in visual data communication. But what makes a visualization trustworthy? Researchers in psychology and behavioral economics have identified processing fluency (i.e., speed and accuracy of perceiving and processing a stimulus) as a key factor impacting trust perception. We examine the association between processing fluency and trust in visualizations through two empirical studies. We manipulated fluency by creating camouflaged visualizations that are more difficult to process. In Experiment 1, we tested the effect of camouflaging a visualization on processing fluency. Participants completed a perceptual task with six camouflaged visualizations and one non-camouflaged control. The task involved estimating the proportion of data values within a range and reporting the difficulty of doing so. We found the camouflaged visualizations produced less accurate estimations compared to the control. In Experiment 2, we created a decision task based on trust games adapted from behavioral economics. We asked participants to invest money in two hypothetical companies and report how much they trust each company. One company communicates its strategy with a camouflaged visualization, the other with a controlled visualization. The results revealed that participants tend to invest less money in the company presenting a camouflaged visualization. We found that processing fluency is a key factor in the perception of trust in visual data communication.",

These observational tools could be on paper and clipboard or on a tablet or computer. In either case, they aren\u2019t necessarily able to provide the context and evidence needed to transform otherwise vague feedback into clear, helpful feedback. We contribute a new design for a tablet-based digital clipboard application to address this problem. Our implementation supports the same style of handheld, pen-based annotation as traditional clipboards, while adding new capabilities like capturing and embedding video annotations in digitized versions of standard observational tools. Observers enter observations and annotations in real-time using a creative combination of pen, touch, and spatial gestures of the clipboard itself that is designed to be efficient and, as much as possible, enable observers to maintain visual focus on the team they are evaluating. Early results include observations recorded during lab-based, iterative design testing for teams of students working together to build a structure out of blocks.",

In this paper, we propose a new hybrid approach to detect the eddy structures in the Red Sea dataset using sea surface height, the velocity field and several geometric criteria. Specifically, we first use minima in the sea surface height to locate the eddy region, which we search for the local minima of velocity magnitude as a precisely located candidate for an eddy center. A circular trace of the velocity field is tested against geometric criteria to confirm coherent and consistent rotation of each eddy. Repeating this test at increasing radii and on deeper planes provides an accurate assessment of eddy width, eddy depth, and a boundary for the eddy region. A comparison of other studies and methods applied to the Red Sea dataset suggests that center detection results are highly dependent on the particularities of method and Our approach provides an reliable detection result of eddy.",

Visualization researchers have developed a large number of web-based VA tools to help data scientists in a wide range of tasks.

Recent surveys suggest computational notebooks have been dominating data scientists' analytical workflows, as these notebooks seamlessly combine text, code, and visualization, allowing users to rapidly iterate code experiments. To help visualization researchers develop VA tools that can be easily integrated into existing data science workflows, we present NOVA, a simple and flexible method to adapt web-based VA systems for notebooks. We provide detailed examples of using this method with diverse web development technologies and different types of computational notebooks. Deployed application examples highlight that NOVA is easy to adopt, and data scientists appreciate in-notebook VA. NOVA is available at https://github.com/poloclub/nova.",

To promote the embedding visualizations\u2019 spatial coherence across epochs, NeuroMapper adapts AlignedUMAP, a recent nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique to align the embeddings.

Different techniques are used to improve data quality depending on the data condition and the cause of poor data quality. Therefore, improving data quality is a timeconsuming and challenging task for users who do not have sufficient knowledge of data. Visual analytics techniques have been proposed to focus on decision support to improve data quality. However, existing studies do not evaluate the impact of data quality improvement on the performance of machine learning models. In addition, existing studies have limitations in which users have to consider all combinations of data quality improvement processes.

The VD system consists of expensive equipment and high maintenance costs and GPS trajectory data measures travel records only for sampled vehicles. On the contrary, CCTV cameras are located at the major intersections in most urban areas. In this study, we propose a framework for analyzing real-time traffic conditions using multiple CCTV videos and predicting future traffic conditions. The proposed framework recognizes vehicles from CCTV images in real-time and extracts vehicle flow data. After that, the urban traffic network is built by combining the vehicle flow data and the CCTV camera network. Since most CCTV cameras only observe a part of the road at the intersection, some traffic flows may not be monitored. Therefore, we introduce a tree search algorithm and an extended DCRNN model to estimate the vehicle flow on unobserved roads.",

We focus on bilingual speakers in Madagascar, a predominantly Malagasy-speaking country with French as a common secondary language. In a between-subjects online study, n = 14 participants answered open-ended questions on how they interact with and communicate about a data visualization delivered in either their native (Malagasy) or secondary (French) language. Results suggest that a lack of expressive terms for visualization, data, and technical terminology in Malagasy impacted participant responses, with several using French terms even when prompted to answer in Malagasy, along with differences in answer length, fluency, and conciseness.",

We introduce Digestable, a visualization tool that generates condensed views of tabular data to enable the identification of high-level features, while supporting detailed exploration. Digestable uses a familiar tabular organization of the data, and the interface for producing condensed views is based on a standard interaction technique for tables: sorting. The visualizations produced by Digestable enable users to obtain a holistic view of the dataset and support the identification of features such as outliers and relationships between variables. We present the Digestable interface, including the methods used to produce condensed views and the visualizations and interactions supporting data exploration.",

What a user sees from the scatterplot can be affected by which privacy algorithm is used and how it adds noise to the data. However, there is no existing work that quantifies this effect. We present the results of a pilot data study that compares algorithms for creating differentially private scatterplots based on the visual utility of their results. We compare five popular algorithms across a range of parameters. The results indicate that DAWA and Geometric Truncated are the best algorithms for visual utility. Future research could focus on optimizing the different parameters to maximize utility of the visual representations.

Large displays can support data exploration by providing space to juxtapose or organize related views. We present an interaction technique for creating many, related views of data for data exploration through synchronous speech and mid-air pointing gestures. We present our design goals, which leverage the combined affordances of speech, pointing gestures and large displays, with the aim of supporting exploratory tasks and transitions. We implemented our design in a large display environment with gesture tracking and a speech input system, along with a touch system for freely positioning visualizations. We implemented this technique in an application called Ditto, and evaluated through a user study where participants explored a COVID-19 dataset. We found that they used both modalities to interact and were able to efficiently create coherent sets of views which could be arranged on the large display.",

However, perceptual studies of visualization effectiveness focus on isolated, low-level tasks, such as estimating specific statistics. Instead, we explore data interpretation and communication more holistically to bridge the gap between visualization designers and consumers. In this work, we conducted a qualitative study on five selected graphs from New York Times to investigate the high-level patterns people naturally see when they encounter a visualization without a guiding task. Participants described each of the tested graphs using natural language. The descriptions were coded using axial coding to identify whether the patterns people observed in the visualizations aligned with the designer's intentions. We found that interpretation varies with the number of subgraphs, additional annotations, labels, and units. Our findings provide a new lens on how design influences the high-level patterns people naturally see in visualization. The subsequent findings and guidelines on visual design can significantly strengthen social trust information visualization when data are visualized in social policies and information contexts.",

Users can identify sense(s) that would ensure optimal perception, cognition, and engagement. This research analyzes and compares user perception in unimodal versus multimodal explorations. Virtual reality (VR) technology was added to measure user immersion levels in a multimodal environment. User experience in VR and non-VR modes was also evaluated.

        "abstract": "Explaining AI-based predictions is fundamental for the development of clinical decision support systems. A common visual approach for explaining imaging data predictions is to overlay saliency maps onto images to allow users to interpret what visual features are associated with a given prediction. This approach can be difficult to utilize when differentiating nuanced concepts. For example, clinicians in neuro-oncology will commonly have to differentiate between a group of similar brain tumors (i.e., a radiographic differential diagnosis). We hypothesized that visual representations of counterfactual conditions could improve the utility of AI-based predictions in the context of such a clinical task because it is analogous to a heuristic commonly used by clinicians when making decisions under uncertainty. We present an initial pilot study in which two board-certified clinicians participated in a three condition study to explore how counterfactual visualizations impact diagnostic performance, decision-making confidence, and decision-making difficulty.",

The scope of project visualizations used span the development, implementation, and evaluation of a social simulation that models a \u2018safer migration\u2019 intervention in the context of low-wage labor migration between Myanmar and Thailand. This project employed dynamic visualizations at various stages, including, participatory social network data collection, mixed-methods social network analysis, conceptualization of violence and migration systems theory, generating and analyzing system and intervention simulations using agent-based modelling, and disseminating web-accessible outputs and findings for a wide audience. Preliminary findings from this ongoing work suggest that using dynamic visual representations of complex systems as a research tool can lead to more pluralistic and interdisciplinary methodological approaches to knowledge production in the field of violence intervention research. Dynamic visualizations can serve as a conduit for empirical richness, a touchpoint for interdisciplinary collaboration, a visual check for model verification, and a supporting tool to assist with stakeholder validation of causal inference, and an instrument to inform intervention development through scenario testing.",

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is poised to play a significant part in supporting the warfighter in the development and selection of plans. The AI capability supports reduction in the planning process which is labor intensive, serial in nature and time consuming. The pace and scale forecast for future planning requires rapid understanding, shaping as well as maintenance of the plan space within a short critical time. Such an AI based planning system will always be intertwined in a workflow process with planning personnel, and thus a requirement for a human interface which allows planning personnel to quickly view, understand and dive into elements of the multitude of plausible plans that are generated by the AI. This is the basis of the Plan Future Graph (PFG) concept which seeks to advance the collaboration between the planner and AI supported planning processes. Furthermore, prototypes of such an interface can be prototyped well in advance of any AI based planning capability becoming mature. This visual and interactive mechanism (PFG) displays the results of AI planning processes and presents it to the planner in a modern and well-designed user interface. It provides the means to view all plausible outcomes of the planning process including the priority selections by the AI. The PFG provides a template to what will be required and fed back into the development process of the AI planner. A model of the PFG and user display and interactive elements are proposed as a means for explainable AI for the planning warfighter The collective PFG interface assists the human planner in decisions at an accelerated pace and scale to select an optimum plan or to assist the AI in re-planning with new or additional criteria.",

Although prior studies have made significant advancements in interpreting a wide range of machine learning algorithms, there is a great demand for relevant studies in the field of reinforcement learning (RL) and explaining agents' behavior. Also, the lack of explainability implies that the optimal strategies of agents cannot be used to improve our understanding of their safety. Explaining the safety measures of an RL agent is important in ensuring its effectiveness. In this work, we improved our explainable RL method, CAPS, and use it for the comparative analysis of the safety behavior pattern of our proposed safety algorithm against the existing RL baseline. We hypothesize that RL safety will result if CAPS transparently offers enough explanations of agents' decisions and actions in terms of safety.",

        "abstract": "Over the years, the number of compromised accounts dramatically increased. Many types of authentication methods have been introduced to avoid this type of attack. In particular, recently taken hold biometric-based such as physical-biometric and behavior-biometric. The idea at the bottom of the last technique is that each person has a unique behavior. Starting from the touch dynamics, and keyboard dynamics nowadays, one of the most promising investigation areas is currently represented by mouse dynamics. Opposite to the other techniques, mouse dynamics require simpler hardware to capture the biometric data without using sensitive data from the users. In this paper, we propose an approach for continuous and silent user authentication based on mouse dynamics and explainable deep learning. We generate a set of images starting from mouse dynamics, and we input a deep learning model to discriminate between legitimate and malicious users. We also propose to adopt the Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping, to allow highlighting the areas of the images which are responsible for a specific legitimate/attack prediction, thus providing explainability behind the model classification. The preliminary experimental analysis based on ten different users shows that the proposed method can be promising in silent and continuous user authentication.",

Data is passed in-memory between each stage of the pipeline, with expensive disk I/O only occurring at the final stage, should a user wish to save their results.  As video games have increased in complexity, developers have turned to procedural generation of 3D models and textures in order to algorithmically generate game content, like foliage or landscapes, without the need for manual modeling. We leverage these new tools in order to import the time-varying data simulated by domain scientists, and to manipulate these assets at runtime in order to update geometry as the simulation runs and more metadata is extracted.",

At the same time, cluster analysis and cluster-based visualization turned out to be highly effective in a system design. Based on the data collected from representative residents, including the location and time they travelled, duration of travel, and expenses at places, we designed ClusBridges, as depicted in Fig. 1, to draw inferences about city regions, traffic bottlenecks, life patterns, and individual life routines to help analyst understand different levels of patterns across the city. The system analyses and visualizes the life patterns of varies aggregation levels in a city in a concise, efficient, and user-friendly manner. The system primarily uses arcs (which can also be called bridges) to present information through arc length, curvature, width, dash, and color. ClusBridges can display information about traffic of various points at different times, view individual routines and cluster similar life routines, and view region trends and metrics.",

Differences in modification patterns between mouse and human protein variants may also indicate evolutionary pressures to preserve functional regions distributed along the protein sequence. However, comparing and contrasting the many possible patterns of modifications is a significant challenge in visualizing proteomics data. For this year\u2019s Bio+MedVis Protein Beasts Challenge, we propose an exploratory interface for pattern discovery. Results from data-driven pattern detectors are displayed using an animation metaphor that is suitable for both comparing and contrasting tasks. In addition, we propose a novel, compact steel-drum like pattern selector component that abstracts from the details of the analysis method and focuses instead on the more playful aspects of an exploratory data analysis that favors instant gratification.",
