However the characteristics and definition of this line of study tend to vary from paper to paper and person to person. In this work, we examine the 37 papers accepted to VisComm from 2018 through 2022. Using grounded theory we identify nuances in how VisComm defines visualization, common themes in the work in this area, and a noticeable gap in DEI practices.",

Since data presentations are commonly shown in temporally sequential order, this study aims at identifying how chart sequences affect data perception and interpretation. We conducted an online survey with two stories in chart sequences which had two charts of either positive or negative polarity. The interplay of chart sequences and their accompanying stories seemed to have an impact on data perception. Certain conditions led to statistically significant perceptual differences. This study can be extended for future research aimed at developing guidelines for effective business presentations or data storytelling.",

        "abstract": "Management of invasive (target) weed species requires time intensive analyses to test whether potential biocontrol agents will suitably control the target species without affecting important native or horticultural (non-target) species. Native or useful plant species closely related to the target species are prioritised over more distant-ly related species as they are more likely to be ecologically, anatomically, and biochemically similar to the target species and, therefore, at greater risk of being affected by candidate biocontrol agents that have co-evolved. A variety of other factors, such as shared biogeographical ranges, ecological niche overlap and functional trait similarities with the target species also contribute to the risk profile of non-target species in testing. Existing tools for the visualisation of data in an evolutionary context do not provide the functionality required for risk analysis in biocontrol research. We have developed a prototype visualisation tool using the R Shiny package that visualises phylogenetic trees together with a heatmap of metrics and ecological trait data for target and non-target plant species to show the distribution of relevant factors in an evolutionary context. We aim to empower biocontrol researchers to summarise and visualise multiple sources of information, thereby speeding up their test list designs and providing a standard that is comparable to consultation with a phylogenetics expert.",

To augment the model's performance, deployers must engage in targeted optimizations aimed at reducing the model's inference latency. Auto-scheduling, an automated technique that generates a range of optimization options, emerges as a viable solution for large-scale auto-deployment. Nevertheless, the low-level code produced by the auto-scheduling method exhibits a striking resemblance to hardware coding, thereby potentially impeding human comprehension and obstructing future manual optimization endeavors. In this ongoing study, we endeavor to develop an enhanced visualization that effectively caters to the extensive profiling metrics associated with auto-scheduling and sheds light on the intricate scheduling process, thereby enabling further improvements in latency optimization through the application of insights derived from the schedule.",

        "abstract": "Multiplayer Online Battle Arenas (MOBAs) have gained a significant player base worldwide, generating over two billion US dollars in annual game revenue. However, the presence of griefers, who deliberately irritate and harass other players within the game, can have a detrimental impact on players' experience, compromising game fairness and potentially leading to the emergence of gray industries. Unfortunately, the absence of a standardized criterion, and the lack of high-quality labeled and annotated data has made it challenging to detect the presence of griefers. Given the complexity of the multi-variant spatiotemporal data for MOBA games, game developers heavily rely on manual review of entire game video recordings to label and annotate griefers, which is a time-consuming process. To alleviate this issue, we have collaborated with a team of game specialists to develop an interactive visual analysis interface, called GrieferLens. It overviews players' behavior analysis and synthesizes their key match events. By presenting multiple views of information, GrieferLens can help the game design team efficiently recognize and label griefers in MOBA games and build up a foundation for creating a more enjoyable and fair gameplay environment.",

But, especially for learners, it can be difficult to structure a critical reflection of creative solutions. We introduce the Critical Design Survey (CDS): structured method that facilitates visualisation design analysis through reflective and critical thought. Applying the CDS helps someone to structure critical thought, provides a unified method that can be readily taught, learners can actively engage with the process and directly use it to write a critical-thinking report of their design ideas. The CDS contains three steps: Step 1, summarise and write down the essence of the idea. Step 2, perform an in-depth critique (we define 30 questions structured in six perspectives). Step 3, synthesise the ideas, implications, and decide on the next steps. We present the CDS, describe our design process (critical thinking workshops, talk aloud, and student use), and describe our use in teaching visualisation to undergraduate and postgraduate students.",

However, visualization of classification models with high number of classes and inter-model comparison in such classification problems are two areas that have not received much attention in the literature, despite the ever-increasing use of classification models to address problems with very large class categories. In this paper, we present our interactive visual analytics tool, called Circles, that allows a visual inter-model comparison of numerous classification models with 1K classes in one view. To mitigate the tricky issue of visual clutter, we chose a concentric radial line layout for our inter-model comparison task. Our prototype shows the results of 9 models with 1K classes in a single view; however, up to 20 models' results can be displayed in this way.",

        "abstract": "There has been an explosion in interest in machine learning (ML) in recent years due to its applications to science and engineering. However, as ML techniques have advanced, tools for explaining and visualizing novel ML algorithms have lagged behind. Animation has been shown to be a powerful tool for making engaging visualizations of systems that dynamically change over time, which makes it well suited to the task of communicating ML algorithms. However, the current approach to animating ML algorithms is to handcraft applications that highlight specific algorithms or use complex generalized animation software. We developed ManimML, an open-source Python library for easily generating animations of ML algorithms directly from code. We sought to leverage ML practitioners' preexisting knowledge of programming rather than requiring them to learn complex animation software.  ManimML has a familiar syntax for specifying neural networks that mimics popular deep learning frameworks like Pytorch. A user can take a preexisting neural network architecture and easily write a specification for an animation in ManimML, which will then automatically compose animations for different components of the system into a final animation of the entire neural network. ManimML is open source and available at https://github.com/helblazer811/ManimML.",

A NPS\u00ae survey is usually accompanied by various ancillary questions to help explain the score and provide deeper insights about the respondents. Sifting through such surveys for thousands of respondents, especially when free-text feedback questions are present, can be a monumental task for small teams. Furthermore, the small team needs to process the feedback quickly and generate reports for high-level discussions by leadership to effect changes in the organization. To overcome these challenges, we have built an interactive dashboard tool with Microsoft Power BI (PowerBI) that contains clear and concise visualizations. We achieved this by applying advance NLP analytics in our normalization steps, thus allowing the summarization of feedback from hundreds of respondents to correlate our findings with the NPS\u00ae. We generated a custom hierarchical cluster heat map as well as a keyword relationship network (wordnet) visual in PowerBI that were instrumental in summarizing a lot of detail into singular visual representations. The tool has since been used multiple times to empower our leadership at BD to make informed decisions about culture and organizational changes in a matter of days instead of weeks/months.",

The task of understanding and analyzing the arguments that emerge during this process can be complex and challenging. To mitigate these challenges, we propose a visualization interface that intuitively illustrates the relationship between contentious sections and key debate points within a debate. The co-occurrence matrix identifies controversial sections, while the speech section graph highlights the primary contentious keywords in their respective contexts. Furthermore, the bar chart displays the frequency of arguments from both pros and cons positions within a contentious section. The circle packing provides a hierarchical representation of issues within a topic, showcasing and comparing the topical keywords between significant pros and cons groups. Through this system, we anticipate that users will be able to visualize the structure and flow of the argument at a glance, thereby facilitating a more comprehensive understanding of the entire debate.",

The prevention and control of nosocomial infections rely on effective training of medical personnel on the correct use of personal prevention equipment (PPE). We introduce a virtual reality (VR) method that simulates the real environment of a hospital and supports repeated immersive practice of PPE donning and doffing. A VR prototype is created and receives positive feedback from a domain expert. The effectiveness of our method will be evaluated in a comparative user study.",

However, existing bitonal image generation methods usually rely on low-level features and their outcomes often vary in quality, making manual inspections and adjustments of the results necessary. In this paper, we propose a novel method for generating bitonal manga backgrounds from color photographs with respect to semantics. Our goal is to preserve the visual richness in the original photograph by not only utilizing rich set of screen patterns but also preserving the distinguishability of different semantics. Several results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and convenience of the proposed method.",

However, interacting with distant objects within the virtual space presents an interaction and usability challenge. Current research primarily focuses on evaluating the feasibility of techniques, which may involve compromises in interaction accuracy or necessitate adjustments to the relative position or scale of target objects. We thus introduce a novel interaction method that enables precise remote interactions without requiring changes to the relative position and scale of the user's point of view in the virtual environment. Additionally, we have developed several variations of our approach and designed a controlled experiment to assess the subjective ranking of these representations and performance differences across multiple scenarios.",

To facilitate it, natural language interfaces (NLIs) can help users explore data through questions. However, existing NLIs lack explanations and visualizations of the analysis process used to uncover the answer. To address this, we introduce Urania, an interactive system that visualizes data analysis pipelines for resolving input questions. It first leverages a novel algorithm to break down questions into analysis pipelines, and then presents pipelines as datamations, with animated operations and data changes. Our experiments show that our algorithm outperforms existing methods in terms of accuracy, and that Urania can help people explore datasets better.",

We present a comprehensive exploration of the narrative construction mechanisms and the efficacy of visualisation techniques in conveying news stories. A novel method is introduced to extract and visualize narratives from large corpora of news articles. We compare two visualisation techniques applied under different information levels to ascertain the nuanced ways in which narratives shape our comprehension and interpretation of news. Furthermore, we examine how visual aids can enhance or distort these narratives. The results of this research could offer fresh insights into how we decode and engage with the dense information landscape prevalent in modern news media.",

        "abstract": "\"The number of edges which cross in a graph drawing is an important measure of readability. Fewer edge crossings results in a drawing which is easier for humans to understand. Graph drawing researchers typically refer to the \"\"crossing number\"\" of a graph; that is, the minimum number of edge crossings when the graph is embedded on a 2D plane. This integer naturally depends on the structure and size of the graph. An integer measure of the \"\"crossiness\"\" of a graph drawing is, however, not useful when comparing graph drawings of different size or structure. Here we present the challenges of devising a normalised \"\"edge crossings\"\" metric scaled in the [0,1] range. A natural definition for this metric is the number of edge crossings in the drawing, divided by the number of possible crossings which could occur. This paper improves upon an existing metric which uses this idea, by giving a tighter upper bound on the maximum possible crossings. We also present the distributions of our new metric for 16,768 graphs, obtained from various random generators and repositories, across 3 layout algorithms.\"",

However, generating an immersive analytical environment is an exhaustive task that requires extensive time and effort. Despite the introduction of various immersive visualization authoring toolkits in the past, there are still significant programming hurdles that hinder domain experts from effectively integrating immersive analytics into their workflow, particularly when faced with dynamically changing data or tasks. To reduce these technical barriers, we introduce a novel immersive analytics authoring framework called XROps, which enables immersive visualization development through visual programming that does not require complex coding. XROps allows for entirely dynamic unified immersive analytics authoring, which can alter the visualization framework according to user needs on-the-fly with immediate feedback. We assessed the usability of XROps through a user study.",

Here we provide evidence for why this is good advice using data from a visual inference experiment. We show how conventional tests are too sensitive, which means that too often the conclusion would be that the model fit is inadequate. The experiment uses the lineup protocol which puts a residual plot in the context of null plots. This helps generate reliable and consistent reading of residual plots for better model diagnosis. The lineup protocol also detects a range of departures from good residuals simultaneously.",

The climax of a data video critically presents the most crucial information to the audience. Nonetheless, building an impactful climax requires lots of guidance. The first step is understanding and visualizing the climax as a narrative stage. We draw inspiration from the mathematical theory of the Golden Ratio. Through an iterative coding process, we first analyzed the Rising-Climax of 63 data videos based on the Freytag pyramid structure. Then, we observed the statistics result between the Rising-Climax and the Golden Ratio. The result showed the potential coherence between the Golden Ratio point for data videos and the Rising-Climax point of data videos. We further conducted a case analysis to demonstrate how applying the Golden Ratio to the Rising-Climax sequence in data videos can enhance its construction.",

We use CLDs (1) during interviews to elicit perspectives from various stakeholders in cities regarding the current state of data governance and (2) during workshops for solution ideation. In this work we focus on the multiplicity of perspectives regarding DG in Australian cities. We aim to co-create a conceptual model of the status quo of data governance and explore solutions to achieve people-centred DG. An interactive visualisation of the model will showcase the diversity of perspectives, delineate the power dynamics underpinning data governance in Australian cities in an accessible manner, and portray people-centred solutions.",

        "abstract": "The process of geospatial data aggregation provides a means for abstracting the complexity of urban systems to not just better understand them, but also protect the privacy of the individuals within them. However, level of aggregation and the arbitrary sizes, shapes, and arrangements of areal units may lead to statistical and visual bias that affects the reliability and validity of findings derived from the analysis of areally aggregated urban data. This bias and resulting analytical uncertainty \u2013 known as the Modifiable Areal Unit Problem (MAUP) \u2013 has implications for public policy implementation and allocation of critical resources in both urban and rural areas. Despite a wealth of geographic research on MAUP and development of advanced statistical approaches to quantifying its effects, many of these insights and techniques remain largely inaccessible and subsequently unadopted by GIS professionals working on city planning applications. This paper introduces a simple vector-to-raster choropleth mapping workflow that enables a broad range of urban analysts to visually assess the scalar effects of the modifiable areal unit problem.",

Evaluation of the visualisation during, and following development revealed that the prototype was well-liked and that having a spatial element to the SLD was useful in understanding the geographical relationships in the power network.

To overcome these problems, we present ProtEGOnist, a novel, interactive visualization approach designed to explore PPI networks with a focus on drug-protein associations. ProtEGOnist addresses the challenges by introducing the concept of ego-graphs to represent local PPI neighborhoods around proteins of interest. These ego-graphs are aggregated into an ego-graph network, where edges between ego-graphs encoded their similarity using the Jaccard index. Our proposed visualization design offers an overview of drug-associated proteins, radar charts to compare protein functions, and detailed ego-graph subnetworks for interactive exploration. Our aim was to reduce visual complexity while enabling detailed exploration, facilitating the discovery of meaningful patterns in PPI networks.

CytoCave leverages existing features of NeuroCave, in- cluding the side-by-side viewports designed for freeform explo- ration of node-link diagrams under various transformations or co- ordinate system embeddings, as well its immersive capabili- ties. However, CytoCave introduces a range of new features that facilitate the exploration of multi-omics networks using di- mensionality reduction projections of high-dimensional biological data with cluster membership highlighting, and includes scalabil- ity upgrades to support visualizing and interacting with large scale proteomics and multi-omics datasets. The CytoCave project source code, which includes the web application JavaScript and the data processing pipeline Jupyter notebook, is available on GitHub at https://github.com/iMammal/CytoCave. In this paper, we describe how to use CytoCave to facilitate the following proteomics and drug discovery tasks. CytoCave enables users: (Task 1) to select a protein and analyze drugs that target them, or, similarly, (Task 2) to select a drug and visualize the proteins that are strongly associated with the drug response. Additionally, CytoCave re-designs the traditional 2D force-directed layout visu- alization of protein interaction networks, providing an interactive interface that allows users to pan, rotate, and zoom in and out of the network, and to switch layouts and color coding templates from a variety of pre-calculated options, with optional pop-up annotations on mouse hovers and edge display / edge hiding on mouse clicks.",

Therefore, making treatment decisions is often challenging. Data visualization methods have recently been developed to visualize time series, single or multiple pieces of information, and complex patient information. We focused on metastatic pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma and summarized the clinical needs and dashboard data visualization ideas for precision medicine.",

        "abstract": "Electronic health records (EHRs), serving as patient-centered repositories for medical data, offer the opportunity for researchers to uncover concealed patterns using machine learning (ML). However, in real-world medical settings, clinicians often face the task of selecting pertinent feature dimensions from a range of potential medical metrics and then deducing potential labels from vague diagnostic descriptions, prior to the modeling phase. This complexity presents challenges in obtaining reliable training/testing data and conducting thorough analysis. Consequently, these hurdles hinder the practical application of ML for automated modeling and comprehensible interpretation of influencing factors. To tackle these challenges, we introduce a visual analytics approach designed to navigate the feature and label space within EHRs, while also streamlining the modeling process through automated ML algorithms and techniques for improved interpretability.",

Advancements in smart home sensing technology also make tracking people\u2019s activities easy in the home, enabling the monitoring of mental health more effectively. Some related works have demonstrated the possibilities of mental health monitoring using sensor data collected in smart homes.  However, there is a lack of prior research on how to effectively utilize smart home data visualization to help people understand how their everyday behaviors are related to their mental health status. This poster presents a case study on data visualization for mental health monitoring in a smart home environment. Our web-based application allows users to browse their self-reported mental health states and home activities and visualize the correlation between mental health states and home activities.",

It is not trivial to correctly diagnose the specific IBD in patients, and wrongly treated patients have to endure the disease effects for a long time, with large costs for the individuals and the healthcare systems. The goal of this work is complementing the examination of individual patients with interactive analyses of cohorts and populations with similar disease patterns to support learning from such similarities for future treatments. We report on additional data and functionality compared to 2021 and discuss an evaluation with eight IBD experts.",
