abstract,,,,,,,,"Scatterplots are among the most widely used visualization techniques. Compelling scatterplot visualizations improve understanding of data by leveraging visual perception to boost awareness when performing specific visual analytic tasks. Design choices in scatterplots, such as graphical encodings or data aspects, can directly impact decision-making quality for low-level tasks like clustering. Hence, constructing frameworks that consider both the perceptions of the visual encodings and the task being performed enables optimizing visualizations to maximize efficacy. In this paper, we propose an automatic tool to optimize the design factors of scatterplots to reveal the most salient cluster structure. Our approach leverages the merge tree data structure to identify the clusters and optimize the choice of subsampling algorithm, sampling rate, marker size, and marker opacity used to generate a scatterplot image. We validate our approach with user and case studies that show it efficiently provides high-quality scatterplot designs from a large parameter space.","Multivariate datasets with many variables are increasingly common in many application areas. Most methods approach multivariate data from a singular perspective. Subspace analysis techniques, on the other hand. provide the user a set of subspaces which can be used to view the data from multiple perspectives. However, many subspace analysis methods produce a huge amount of subspaces, a number of which are usually redundant. The enormity of the number of subspaces can be overwhelming to analysts, making it difficult for them to find informative patterns in the data. In this paper, we propose a new paradigm that constructs semantically consistent subspaces. These subspaces can then be expanded into more general subspaces by ways of conventional techniques. Our framework uses the labels/meta-data of a dataset to learn the semantic meanings and associations of the attributes. We employ a neural network to learn a semantic word embedding of the attributes and then divide this attribute space into semantically consistent subspaces. The user is provided with a visual analytics interface that guides the analysis process. We show via various examples that these semantic subspaces can help organize the data and guide the user in finding interesting patterns in the dataset.","Increasingly, visualization practitioners are working with, using, and studying private and sensitive data. There can be many stakeholders interested in the resulting analyses—but widespread sharing of the data can cause harm to individuals, companies, and organizations. Practitioners are increasingly turning to differential privacy to enable public sharing of data with a guaranteed amount of privacy. Differential privacy algorithms do this by aggregating data statistics with noise, and this now-private data can be released visually with differentially private scatterplots. While the private visual output is affected by the algorithm choice, privacy level, bin number, data distribution, and user task, there is little guidance on how to choose and balance the effect of these parameters. To address this gap, we had experts examine 1,200 differentially private scatterplots created with a variety of parameter choices and tested their ability to see aggregate patterns in the private output (i.e. the visual utility of the chart). We synthesized these results to provide easy-to-use guidance for visualization practitioners releasing private data through scatterplots. Our findings also provide a ground truth for visual utility, which we use to benchmark automated utility metrics from a variety of fields. We demonstrate how multi-scale structural similarity (MS-SSIM), the metric most strongly correlated with our study’s utility results, can be used to optimize parameter selection. A free copy of this paper along with all supplemental materials is available at https://osf.io/wej4s/.",,,,"Guidelines for color use in quantitative visualizations have strongly discouraged the use of rainbow colormaps, arguing instead for smooth designs that do not induce visual discontinuities or implicit color categories. However, the empirical evidence behind this argument has been mixed and, at times, even contradictory. In practice, rainbow colormaps are widely used, raising questions about the true utility or dangers of such designs. We study how color categorization impacts the interpretation of scalar fields. We first introduce an approach to detect latent categories in colormaps. We hypothesize that the appearance of color categories in scalar visualizations can be beneficial in that they enhance the perception of certain features, although at the cost of rendering other features less noticeable. In three crowdsourced experiments, we show that observers are more likely to discriminate global, distributional features when viewing colorful scales that induce categorization (e.g., rainbow or diverging schemes). Conversely, when seeing the same data through a less colorful representation, observers are more likely to report localized features defined by small variations in the data. Participants showed awareness of these different affordances, and exhibited bias for exploiting the more discriminating colormap, given a particular feature type. Our results demonstrate costs and benefits for rainbows (and similarly colorful schemes), suggesting that their complementary utility for analyzing scalar data should not be dismissed. In addition to explaining potentially valid uses of rainbow, our study provides actionable guidelines, including on when such designs can be more harmful than useful. Data and materials are available at https://osf.io/xjhtf","We present an approach for interactively visualizing data using color-changing inks without the need for electronic displays or computers. Color-changing inks are a family of physical inks that change their color characteristics in response to an external stimulus such as heat, UV light, water, and pressure. Visualizations created using color-changing inks can embed interactivity in printed material without external computational media. In this paper, we survey current color-changing ink technology and then use these findings to derive a framework for how it can be used to construct interactive data representations. We also enumerate the interaction techniques possible using this technology. We then show some examples of how to use color-changing ink to create interactive visualizations on paper. While obviously limited in scope to situations where no power or computing is present, or as a complement to digital displays, our findings can be employed for paper, data physicalization, and embedded visualizations.",,,,,"Dashboards, which comprise multiple views on a single display, help analyze and communicate multiple perspectives of data simultaneously. However, creating effective and elegant dashboards is challenging since it requires careful and logical arrangement and coordination of multiple visualizations. To solve the problem, we propose a data-driven approach for mining design rules from dashboards and automating dashboard organization. Specifically, we focus on two prominent aspects of the organization: arrangement, which describes the position, size, and layout of each view in the display space; and coordination, which indicates the interaction between pairwise views. We build a new dataset containing 854 dashboards crawled online, and develop feature engineering methods for describing the single views and view-wise relationships in terms of data, encoding, layout, and interactions. Further, we identify design rules among those features and develop a recommender for dashboard design. We demonstrate the usefulness of DMiner through an expert study and a user study. The expert study shows that our extracted design rules are reasonable and conform to the design practice of experts. Moreover, a comparative user study shows that our recommender could help automate dashboard organization and reach human-level performance. In summary, our work offers a promising starting point for design mining visualizations to build recommenders.","Composite visualization is a popular design strategy that represents complex datasets by integrating multiple visualizations in a meaningful and aesthetic layout, such as juxtaposition, overlay, and nesting. With this strategy, numerous novel designs have been proposed in visualization publications to accomplish various visual analytic tasks. However, there is a lack of understanding of design patterns of composite visualization, thus failing to provide holistic design space and concrete examples for practical use. In this paper, we opted to revisit the composite visualizations in IEEE VIS publications and answered what and how visualizations of different types are composed together. To achieve this, we first constructed a corpus of composite visualizations from the publications and analyzed common practices, such as the pattern distributions and co-occurrence of visualization types. From the analysis, we obtained insights into different design patterns on the utilities and their potential pros and cons. Furthermore, we discussed usage scenarios of our taxonomy and corpus and how future research on visualization composition can be conducted on the basis of this study.","Multiple-view (MV) visualizations have become ubiquitous for visual communication and exploratory data visualization. However, most existing MV visualizations are designed for the desktop, which can be unsuitable for the continuously evolving displays of varying screen sizes. In this paper, we present a two-stage adaptation framework that supports the automated retargeting and semi-automated tailoring of a desktop MV visualization for rendering on devices with displays of varying sizes. First, we cast layout retargeting as an optimization problem and propose a simulated annealing technique that can automatically preserve the layout of multiple views. Second, we enable fine-tuning for the visual appearance of each view, using a rule-based auto configuration method complemented with an interactive interface for chart-oriented encoding adjustment. To demonstrate the feasibility and expressivity of our proposed approach, we present a gallery of MV visualizations that have been adapted from the desktop to small displays. We also report the result of a user study comparing visualizations generated using our approach with those by existing methods. The outcome indicates that the participants generally prefer visualizations generated using our approach and find them to be easier to use.",,,,,,"Delivering customer services through video communications has brought new opportunities to analyze customer satisfaction for quality management. However, due to the lack of reliable self-reported responses, service providers are troubled by the inadequate estimation of customer services and the tedious investigation into multimodal video recordings. We introduce Anchorage , a visual analytics system to evaluate customer satisfaction by summarizing multimodal behavioral features in customer service videos and revealing abnormal operations in the service process. We leverage the semantically meaningful operations to introduce structured event understanding into videos which help service providers quickly navigate to events of their interest. Anchorage supports a comprehensive evaluation of customer satisfaction from the service and operation levels and efficient analysis of customer behavioral dynamics via multifaceted visualization views. We extensively evaluate Anchorage through a case study and a carefully-designed user study. The results demonstrate its effectiveness and usability in assessing customer satisfaction using customer service videos. We found that introducing event contexts in assessing customer satisfaction can enhance its performance without compromising annotation precision. Our approach can be adapted in situations where unlabelled and unstructured videos are collected along with sequential records.",,,,"Distributed tracing tools have emerged in recent years to enable the operators of modern internet applications to troubleshoot cross-component problems in deployed applications. Due to the rich, detailed diagnostic data captured by distributed tracing tools, effectively presenting this data is important. However, use of visualisation to enable perceptual sensemaking of this complex data in today’s distributed tracing tools has received relatively little attention. Consequently, operators struggle to make effective use of existing tools. In this paper we present the first characterisation of distributed tracing visualisation through a qualitative interview study with six practitioners from two large internet companies. Across two rounds of 1-on-1 interviews we use grounded theory coding to establish users, extract concrete use cases and identify shortcomings of existing distributed tracing tools. We derive guidelines for development of future distributed tracing tools and expose several open research problems that have wide reaching implications for visualisation research and other domain applications.","We present experimental results to explore a form of bivariate glyphs for representing large-magnitude-range vectors. The glyphs meet two conditions: (1) two visual dimensions are separable; and (2) one of the two visual dimensions uses a categorical representation (e.g., a categorical colormap). We evaluate how much these two conditions determine the bivariate glyphs’ effectiveness. The first experiment asks participants to perform three local tasks requiring reading no more than two glyphs. The second experiment scales up the search space in global tasks when participants must look at the entire scene of hundreds of vector glyphs to get an answer. Our results support that the first condition is necessary for local tasks when a few items are compared. But it is not enough for understanding a large amount of data. The second condition is necessary for perceiving global structures of examining very complex datasets. Participants’ comments reveal that the categorical features in the bivariate glyphs trigger emergent optimal viewers’ behaviors. This work contributes to perceptually accurate glyph representations for revealing patterns from large scientific results. We release source code, quantum physics data, training documents, participants’ answers, and statistical analyses for reproducible science at https : //osf.io/4xcf5/?viewonly = 94123139df9c4ac984a1e0df811cd580.","Machine learning models have gained traction as decision support tools for tasks that require processing copious amounts of data. However, to achieve the primary benefits of automating this part of decision-making, people must be able to trust the machine learning model's outputs. In order to enhance people's trust and promote appropriate reliance on the model, visualization techniques such as interactive model steering, performance analysis, model comparison, and uncertainty visualization have been proposed. In this study, we tested the effects of two uncertainty visualization techniques in a college admissions forecasting task, under two task difficulty levels, using Amazon's Mechanical Turk platform. Results show that (1) people's reliance on the model depends on the task difficulty and level of machine uncertainty and (2) ordinal forms of expressing model uncertainty are more likely to calibrate model usage behavior. These outcomes emphasize that reliance on decision support tools can depend on the cognitive accessibility of the visualization technique and perceptions of model performance and task difficulty.","Idealized probability distributions, such as normal or other curves, lie at the root of confirmatory statistical tests. But how well do people understand these idealized curves? In practical terms, does the human visual system allow us to match sample data distributions with hypothesized population distributions from which those samples might have been drawn? And how do different visualization techniques impact this capability? This paper shares the results of a crowdsourced experiment that tested the ability of respondents to fit normal curves to four different data distribution visualizations: bar histograms, dotplot histograms, strip plots, and boxplots. We find that the crowd can estimate the center (mean) of a distribution with some success and little bias. We also find that people generally overestimate the standard deviation---which we dub the ""umbrella effect"" because people tend to want to cover the whole distribution using the curve, as if sheltering it from the heavens above---and that strip plots yield the best accuracy.",,,"With the increasing pervasiveness of Artificial Intelligence (AI), many visual analytics tools have been proposed to examine fairness, but they mostly focus on data scientist users. Instead, tackling fairness must be inclusive and involve domain experts with specialized tools and workflows. Thus, domain-specific visualizations are needed for algorithmic fairness. Furthermore, while much work on AI fairness has focused on predictive decisions, less has been done for fair allocation and planning, which require human expertise and iterative design to integrate myriad constraints. We propose the Intelligible Fair Allocation (IF-Alloc) Framework that leverages explanations of causal attribution (Why), contrastive (Why Not) and counterfactual reasoning (What If, How To) to aid domain experts to assess and alleviate unfairness in allocation problems. We apply the framework to fair urban planning for designing cities that provide equal access to amenities and benefits for diverse resident types. Specifically, we propose an interactive visual tool, Intelligible Fair City Planner (IF-City), to help urban planners to perceive inequality across groups, identify and attribute sources of inequality, and mitigate inequality with automatic allocation simulations and constraint-satisfying recommendations (IF-Plan). We demonstrate and evaluate the usage and usefulness of IF-City on a real neighborhood in New York City, US, with practicing urban planners from multiple countries, and discuss generalizing our findings, application, and framework to other use cases and applications of fair allocation.","Spatial and temporal interactions are central and fundamental in many activities in our world. A common problem faced when visualizing this type of data is how to provide an overview that helps users navigate efficiently. Traditional approaches use coordinated views or 3D metaphors like the Space-time cube to tackle this problem. However, they suffer from overplotting and often lack spatial context, hindering data exploration. More recent techniques, such as MotionRugs, propose compact temporal summaries based on 1D projection. While powerful, these techniques do not support the situation for which the spatial extent of the objects and their intersections is relevant, such as the analysis of surveillance videos or tracking weather storms. In this paper, we propose MoReVis, a visual overview of spatiotemporal data that considers the objects' spatial extent and strives to show spatial interactions among these objects by displaying spatial intersections. Like previous techniques, our method involves projecting the spatial coordinates to 1D to produce compact summaries. However, our solution's core consists of performing a layout optimization step that sets the size and positions of the visual marks on the summary to resemble the actual values on the original space. We also provide multiple interactive mechanisms to make interpreting the results more straightforward for the user. We perform an extensive experimental evaluation and usage scenarios. Moreover, we evaluated the usefulness of MoReVis in a study with 9 participants. The results point out the effectiveness and suitability of our method in representing different datasets compared to traditional techniques.","Numerous patterns found in urban phenomena, such as air pollution and human mobility, can be characterized as many directed geospatial networks (geo-networks) that represent spreading processes in urban space. These geo-networks can be analyzed from multiple levels, ranging from the macro-level of summarizing all geo-networks, meso-level of comparing or summarizing parts of geo-networks, and micro-level of inspecting individual geo-networks. Most of the existing visualizations cannot support multilevel analysis well. These techniques work by: 1) showing geo-networks separately with multiple maps leads to heavy context switching costs between different maps; 2) summarizing all geo-networks into a single network can lead to the loss of individual information; 3) drawing all geo-networks onto one map might suffer from the visual scalability issue in distinguishing individual geo-networks. In this study, we propose GeoNetverse, a novel visualization technique for analyzing aggregate geo-networks from multiple levels. Inspired by metro maps, GeoNetverse balances the overview and details of the geo-networks by placing the edges shared between geo-networks in a stacked manner. To enhance the visual scalability, GeoNetverse incorporates a level-of-detail rendering, a progressive crossing minimization, and a coloring technique. A set of evaluations was conducted to evaluate GeoNetverse from multiple perspectives.","Arguably the most representative application of artificial intelligence, autonomous driving systems usually rely on computer vision techniques to detect the situations of the external environment. Object detection underpins the ability of scene understanding in such systems. However, existing object detection algorithms often behave as a black box, so when a model fails, no information is available on When, Where and How the failure happened. In this paper, we propose a visual analytics approach to help model developers interpret the model failures. The system includes the micro- and macro-interpreting modules to address the interpretability problem of object detection in autonomous driving. The micro-interpreting module extracts and visualizes the features of a convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithm with density maps, while the macro-interpreting module provides spatial-temporal information of an autonomous driving vehicle and its environment. With the situation awareness of the spatial, temporal and neural network information, our system facilitates the understanding of the results of object detection algorithms, and helps the model developers better understand, tune and develop the models. We use real-world autonomous driving data to perform case studies by involving domain experts in computer vision and autonomous driving to evaluate our system. The results from our interviews with them show the effectiveness of our approach.",,,,,,,,,,,"DNGs are diverse network graphs with texts and different styles of nodes and edges, including mind maps, modeling graphs, and flowcharts. They are high-level visualizations that are easy for humans to understand but difficult for machines. Inspired by the process of human perception of graphs, we propose a method called GraphDecoder to extract data from raster images. Given a raster image, we extract the content based on a neural network. We built a semantic segmentation network based on U-Net. We increase the attention mechanism module, simplify the network model, and design a specific loss function to improve the model's ability to extract graph data. After this semantic segmentation network, we can extract the data of all nodes and edges. We then combine these data to obtain the topological relationship of the entire DNG. We also provide an interactive interface for users to redesign the DNGs. We verify the effectiveness of our method by evaluations and user studies on datasets collected on the Internet and generated datasets.","In social networks, individuals’ decisions are strongly influenced by recommendations from their friends, acquaintances, and favorite renowned personalities. The popularity of online social networking platforms makes them the prime venues to advertise products and promote opinions. The Influence Maximization (IM) problem entails selecting a seed set of users that maximizes the influence spread, i.e., the expected number of users positively influenced by a stochastic diffusion process triggered by the seeds. Engineering and analyzing IM algorithms remains a difficult and demanding task due to the NP-hardness of the problem and the stochastic nature of the diffusion processes. Despite several heuristics being introduced, they often fail in providing enough information on how the network topology affects the diffusion process, precious insights that could help researchers improve their seed set selection. In this paper, we present VAIM, a visual analytics system that supports users in analyzing, evaluating, and comparing information diffusion processes determined by different IM algorithms. Furthermore, VAIM provides useful insights that the analyst can use to modify the seed set of an IM algorithm, so to improve its influence spread. We assess our system by: (i) a qualitative evaluation based on a guided experiment with two domain experts on two different data sets; (ii) a quantitative estimation of the value of the proposed visualization through the ICE-T methodology by Wall (IEEE TVCG - 2018). The twofold assessment indicates that VAIM effectively supports our target users in the visual analysis of the performance of IM algorithms.",,,,,"Dimension reduction (DR) is commonly utilized to capture the intrinsic structure and transform high-dimensional data into low-dimensional space while retaining meaningful properties of the original data. It is used in various applications, such as image recognition, single-cell sequencing analysis, and biomarker discovery. However, contemporary parametric-free and parametric DR techniques suffer from several significant shortcomings, such as the inability to preserve global and local features and the pool generalization performance. On the other hand, regarding explainability, it is crucial to comprehend the embedding process, especially the contribution of each part to the embedding process, while understanding how each feature affects the embedding results that identify critical components and help diagnose the embedding process. To address these problems, we have developed a deep neural network method called EVNet, which provides not only excellent performance in structural maintainability but also explainability to the DR therein. EVNet starts with data augmentation and a manifold-based loss function to improve embedding performance. The explanation is based on saliency maps and aims to examine the trained EVNet parameters and contributions of components during the embedding process. The proposed techniques are integrated with a visual interface to help the user to adjust EVNet to achieve better DR performance and explainability. The interactive visual interface makes it easier to illustrate the data features, compare different DR techniques, and investigate DR. An in-depth experimental comparison shows that EVNet consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in both performance measures and explainability.","With the surge of data-driven analysis techniques, there is a rising demand for enhancing the exploration of large high-dimensional data by enabling interactions for the joint analysis of features (i.e., dimensions). Such a dual analysis of the feature space and data space is characterized by three components, (1) a view visualizing feature summaries, (2) a view that visualizes the data records, and (3) a bidirectional linking of both plots triggered by human interaction in one of both visualizations, e.g., Linking & Brushing. Dual analysis approaches span many domains, e.g., medicine, crime analysis, and biology. The proposed solutions encapsulate various techniques, such as feature selection or statistical analysis. However, each approach establishes a new definition of dual analysis. To address this gap, we systematically reviewed published dual analysis methods to investigate and formalize the key elements, such as the techniques used to visualize the feature space and data space, as well as the interaction between both spaces. From the information elicited during our review, we propose a unified theoretical framework for dual analysis, encompassing all existing approaches extending the field. We apply our proposed formalization describing the interactions between each component and relate them to the addressed tasks. Additionally, we categorize the existing approaches using our framework and derive future research directions to advance dual analysis by including state-of-the-art visual analysis techniques to improve data exploration.",,,,"High-quality visualization collections are beneficial for a variety of applications including visualization reference and data-driven visualization design. The visualization community has created many visualization collections, and developed interactive exploration systems for the collections. However, the systems are mainly based on extrinsic attributes like authors and publication years, whilst neglect intrinsic property ( i.e ., visual appearance) of visualizations, hindering visual comparison and query of visualization designs. This paper presents VISAtlas , an image-based approach empowered by neural image embedding, to facilitate exploration and query for visualization collections. To improve embedding accuracy, we create a comprehensive collection of synthetic and real-world visualizations, and use it to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) model with a triplet loss for taxonomical classification of visualizations. Next, we design a coordinated multiple view (CMV) system that enables multi-perspective exploration and design retrieval based on visualization embeddings. Specifically, we design a novel embedding overview that leverages contextual layout framework to preserve the context of the embedding vectors with the associated visualization taxonomies, and density plot and sampling techniques to address the overdrawing problem. We demonstrate in three case studies and one user study the effectiveness of VISAtlas in supporting comparative analysis of visualization collections, exploration of composite visualizations, and image-based retrieval of visualization designs. The studies reveal that real-world visualization collections ( e.g ., Beagle and VIS30K) better accord with the richness and diversity of visualization designs than synthetic collections ( e.g ., Data2Vis), inspiring composite visualizations are identified in real-world collections, and distinct design patterns exist in visualizations from different sources.","Image collage is a very useful tool for visualizing an image collection. Most of the existing methods and commercial applications for generating image collages are designed on simple shapes, such as rectangular and circular layouts. This greatly limits the use of image collages in some artistic and creative settings. Although there are some methods that can generate irregularly-shaped image collages, they often suffer from severe image overlapping and excessive blank space. This prevents such methods from being effective information communication tools. In this paper, we present a shape slicing algorithm and an optimization scheme that can create image collages of arbitrary shapes in an informative and visually pleasing manner given an input shape and an image collection. To overcome the challenge of irregular shapes, we propose a novel algorithm, called Shape-Aware Slicing, which partitions the input shape into cells based on medial axis and binary slicing tree. Shape-Aware Slicing, which is designed specifically for irregular shapes, takes human perception and shape structure into account to generate visually pleasing partitions. Then, the layout is optimized by analyzing input images with the goal of maximizing the total salient regions of the images. To evaluate our method, we conduct extensive experiments and compare our results against previous work. The evaluations show that our proposed algorithm can efficiently arrange image collections on irregular shapes and create visually superior results than prior work and existing commercial tools.","Images in visualization publications contain rich information, e.g., novel visualization designs and implicit design patterns of visualizations. A systematic collection of these images can contribute to the community in many aspects, such as literature analysis and automated tasks for visualization. In this paper, we build and make public a dataset, VisImages, which collects 12,267 images with captions from 1,397 papers in IEEE InfoVis and VAST. Built upon a comprehensive visualization taxonomy, the dataset includes 35,096 visualizations and their bounding boxes in the images. We demonstrate the usefulness of VisImages through three use cases: 1) investigating the use of visualizations in the publications with VisImages Explorer, 2) training and benchmarking models for visualization classification, and 3) localizing visualizations in the visual analytics systems automatically.",,,,"Immersive visualization in virtual reality (VR) allows us to exploit visual cues for perception in 3D space, yet few existing studies have measured the effects of visual cues. Across a desktop monitor and a head-mounted display (HMD), we assessed scatterplot designs which vary their use of visual cues—motion, shading, perspective (graphical projection), and dimensionality—on two sets of data. We conducted a user study with a summary task in which 32 participants estimated the classification accuracy of an artificial neural network from the scatterplots. With Bayesian multilevel modeling, we capture the intricate visual effects and find that no cue alone explains all the variance in estimation error. Visual motion cues generally reduce participants’ estimation error; besides this motion, using other cues may increase participants’ estimation error. Using an HMD, adding visual motion cues, providing a third data dimension, or showing a more complicated dataset leads to longer response times. We speculate that most visual cues may not strongly affect perception in immersive analytics unless they change people’s mental model about data. In summary, by studying participants as they interpret the output from a complicated machine learning model, we advance our understanding of how to use the visual cues in immersive analytics.",,,,,,"As online news increasingly include data journalism, there is a corresponding increase in the incorporation of visualization in article thumbnail images. However, little research exists on the design rationale for visualization thumbnails, such as resizing, cropping, simplifying, and embellishing charts that appear within the body of the associated article. Therefore, in this paper we aim to understand these design choices and determine what makes a visualization thumbnail inviting and interpretable. To this end, we first survey visualization thumbnails collected online and discuss visualization thumbnail practices with data journalists and news graphics designers. Based on the survey and discussion results, we then define a design space for visualization thumbnails and conduct a user study with four types of visualization thumbnails derived from the design space. The study results indicate that different chart components play different roles in attracting reader attention and enhancing reader understandability of the visualization thumbnails. We also find various thumbnail design strategies for effectively combining the charts' components, such as a data summary with highlights and data labels, and a visual legend with text labels and Human Recognizable Objects (HROs), into thumbnails. Ultimately, we distill our findings into design implications that allow effective visualization thumbnail designs for data-rich news articles. Our work can thus be seen as a first step toward providing structured guidance on how to design compelling thumbnails for data stories.",,,,"Large tree structures are ubiquitous and real-world relational datasets often have information associated with nodes (e.g., labels or other attributes) and edges (e.g., weights or distances) that need to be communicated to the viewers. Yet, scalable, easy to read tree layouts are difficult to achieve. We consider tree layouts to be readable if they meet some basic requirements: node labels should not overlap, edges should not cross, edge lengths should be preserved, and the output should be compact. There are many algorithms for drawing trees, although very few take node labels or edge lengths into account, and none optimizes all requirements above. With this in mind, we propose a new scalable method for readable tree layouts. The algorithm guarantees that the layout has no edge crossings and no label overlaps, and optimizing one of the remaining aspects: desired edge lengths and compactness. We evaluate the performance of the new algorithm by comparison with related earlier approaches using several real-world datasets, ranging from a few thousand nodes to hundreds of thousands of nodes. Tree layout algorithms can be used to visualize large general graphs, by extracting a hierarchy of progressively larger trees. We illustrate this functionality by presenting several map-like visualizations generated by the new tree layout algorithm.","In this paper, we propose the t-FDP model, a force-directed placement method based on a novel bounded short-range force (t-force) defined by Student’s t-distribution. Our formulation is flexible, exerts limited repulsive forces for nearby nodes and can be adapted separately in its short- and long-range effects. Using such forces in force-directed graph layouts yields better neighborhood preservation than current methods, while maintaining low stress errors. Our efficient implementation using a Fast Fourier Transform is one order of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art methods and two orders faster on the GPU, enabling us to perform parameter tuning by globally and locally adjusting the t-force in real-time even for complex graphs of up to 10.000 nodes. We demonstrate the quality of our approach by numerical evaluation against state-of-the-art approaches and extensions for interactive exploration.","We present Target Netgrams as a visualization technique for radial layouts of graphs. Inspired by manually created target sociograms, we propose an annulus-constrained stress model that aims to position nodes onto the annuli between adjacent circles for indicating their radial hierarchy, while maintaining the network structure (clusters and neighborhoods) and improving readability as much as possible. This is achieved by having more space on the annuli than traditional layout techniques. By adapting stress majorization to this model, the layout is computed as a constrained least square optimization problem. Additional constraints (e.g., parent-child preservation, attribute-based clusters and structure-aware radii) are provided for exploring nodes, edges, and levels of interest. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through a comprehensive evaluation, a user study, and a case study.",,,,,"Many Information Retrieval (IR) approaches have been proposed to extract relevant information from a large corpus. Among these methods, phrase-based retrieval methods have been proven to capture more concrete and concise information than word-based and paragraph-based methods. However, due to the complex relationship among phrases and a lack of proper visual guidance, achieving user-driven interactive information-seeking and retrieval remains challenging. In this study, we present a visual analytic approach for users to seek information from an extensive collection of documents efficiently. The main component of our approach is a PhraseMap, where nodes and edges represent the extracted keyphrases and their relationships, respectively, from a large corpus. To build the PhraseMap, we extract keyphrases from each document and link the phrases according to word attention determined using modern language models, i.e., BERT. As can be imagined, the graph is complex due to the extensive volume of information and the massive amount of relationships. Therefore, we develop a navigation algorithm to facilitate information seeking. It includes (1) a question-answering (QA) model to identify phrases related to users’ queries and (2) updating relevant phrases based on users’ feedback. To better present the PhraseMap, we introduce a resource-controlled self-organizing map (RC-SOM) to evenly and regularly display phrases on grid cells while expecting phrases with similar semantics to stay close in the visualization. To evaluate our approach, we conducted case studies with three domain experts in diverse literature. The results and feedback demonstrate its effectiveness, usability, and intelligence.","Open-domain question answering (OpenQA) is an essential but challenging task in natural language processing that aims to answer questions in natural language formats on the basis of large-scale unstructured passages. Recent research has taken the performance of benchmark datasets to new heights, especially when these datasets are combined with techniques for machine reading comprehension based on Transformer models. However, as identified through our ongoing collaboration with domain experts and our review of literature, three key challenges limit their further improvement: (i) complex data with multiple long texts, (ii) complex model architecture with multiple modules, and (iii) semantically complex decision process. In this paper, we present VEQA, a visual analytics system that helps experts understand the decision reasons of OpenQA and provides insights into model improvement. The system summarizes the data flow within and between modules in the OpenQA model as the decision process takes place at the summary, instance and candidate levels. Specifically, it guides users through a summary visualization of dataset and module response to explore individual instances with a ranking visualization that incorporates context. Furthermore, VEQA supports fine-grained exploration of the decision flow within a single module through a comparative tree visualization. We demonstrate the effectiveness of VEQA in promoting interpretability and providing insights into model enhancement through a case study and expert evaluation.",,,,"Although deep learning has demonstrated its capability in solving diverse scientific visualization problems, it still lacks generalization power across different tasks. To address this challenge, we propose CoordNet, a single coordinate-based framework that tackles various tasks relevant to time-varying volumetric data visualization without modifying the network architecture. The core idea of our approach is to decompose diverse task inputs and outputs into a unified representation (i.e., coordinates and values) and learn a function from coordinates to their corresponding values. We achieve this goal using a residual block-based implicit neural representation architecture with periodic activation functions. We evaluate CoordNet on data generation (i.e., temporal super-resolution and spatial super-resolution) and visualization generation (i.e., view synthesis and ambient occlusion prediction) tasks using time-varying volumetric data sets of various characteristics. The experimental results indicate that CoordNet achieves better quantitative and qualitative results than the state-of-the-art approaches across all the evaluated tasks.","We present a novel technique for hierarchical super resolution (SR) with neural networks (NNs), which upscales volumetric data represented with an octree data structure to a high-resolution uniform grid with minimal seam artifacts on octree node boundaries. Our method uses existing state-of-the-art SR models and adds flexibility to upscale input data with varying levels of detail across the domain, instead of only uniform grid data that are supported in previous approaches. The key is to use a hierarchy of SR NNs, each trained to perform 2x SR between two levels of detail, with a hierarchical SR algorithm that minimizes seam artifacts by starting from the coarsest level of detail and working up. We show that our hierarchical approach outperforms baseline interpolation and hierarchical upscaling methods, and demonstrate the usefulness of our proposed approach across three use cases including data reduction using hierarchical downsampling+SR instead of uniform downsampling+SR, computation savings for hierarchical finite-time Lyapunov exponent field calculation, and super-resolving low-resolution simulation results for a high-resolution approximation visualization.","Neural networks have shown great potential in compressing volume data for visualization. However, due to the high cost of training and inference, such volumetric neural representations have thus far only been applied to offline data processing and non-interactive rendering. In this paper, we demonstrate that by simultaneously leveraging modern GPU tensor cores, a native CUDA neural network framework, and a well-designed rendering algorithm with macro-cell acceleration, we can interactively ray trace volumetric neural representations (10-60fps). Our neural representations are also high-fidelity (PSNR > 30dB) and compact (10-1000x smaller). Additionally, we show that it is possible to fit the entire training step inside a rendering loop and skip the pre-training process completely. To support extreme-scale volume data, we also develop an efficient out-of-core training strategy, which allows our volumetric neural representation training to potentially scale up to terascale using only an NVIDIA RTX 3090 workstation.",,,,,,,"Neurons have a polarized structure, with dendrites and axons, and compartment-specific functions can be affected by the dwelling mitochondria. Recent studies have shown that the morphology of mitochondria is closely related to the functions of neurons and neurodegenerative diseases. However, the conventional mitochondria analysis workflow mainly relies on manual annotations and generic image-processing software. Moreover, even though there have been recent developments in automatic mitochondria analysis using deep learning, the application of existing methods in a daily analysis remains challenging because the performance of a pretrained deep learning model can vary depending on the target data, and there are always errors in inference time, requiring human proofreading. To address these issues, we introduce MitoVis, a novel visualization system for end-to-end data processing and an interactive analysis of the morphology of neuronal mitochondria. MitoVis introduces a novel active learning framework based on recent contrastive learning, which allows accurate fine-tuning of the neural network model. MitoVis also provides novel visual guides for interactive proofreading so that users can quickly identify and correct errors in the result with minimal effort. We demonstrate the usefulness and efficacy of the system via case studies conducted by neuroscientists. The results show that MitoVis achieved up to 13.3× faster total analysis time in the case study compared to the conventional manual analysis workflow.","Genomics researchers increasingly use multiple reference genomes to comprehensively explore genetic variants underlying differences in detectable characteristics between organisms. Pangenomes allow for an efficient data representation of multiple related genomes and their associated metadata. However, current visual analysis approaches for exploring these complex genotype-phenotype relationships are often based on single reference approaches or lack adequate support for interpreting the variants in the genomic context with heterogeneous (meta)data. This design study introduces PanVA, a visual analytics design for pangenomic variant analysis developed with the active participation of genomics researchers. The design uniquely combines tailored visual representations with interactions such as sorting, grouping, and aggregation, allowing users to navigate and explore different perspectives on complex genotype-phenotype relations. Through evaluation in the context of plants and pathogen research, we show that PanVA helps researchers explore variants in genes and generate hypotheses about their role in phenotypic variation.",,,,"Missing data can pose a challenge for machine learning (ML) modeling. To address this, current approaches are categorized into feature imputation and label prediction and are primarily focused on handling missing data to enhance ML performance. These approaches rely on the observed data to estimate the missing values and therefore encounter three main shortcomings in imputation, including the need for different imputation methods for various missing data mechanisms, heavy dependence on the assumption of data distribution, and potential introduction of bias. This study proposes a Contrastive Learning (CL) framework to model observed data with missing values, where the ML model learns the similarity between an incomplete sample and its complete counterpart and the dissimilarity between other samples. Our proposed approach demonstrates the advantages of CL without requiring any imputation. To enhance interpretability, we introduce CIVis, a visual analytics system that incorporates interpretable techniques to visualize the learning process and diagnose the model status. Users can leverage their domain knowledge through interactive sampling to identify negative and positive pairs in CL. The output of CIVis is an optimized model that takes specified features and predicts downstream tasks. We provide two usage scenarios in regression and classification tasks and conduct quantitative experiments, expert interviews, and a qualitative user study to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. In short, this study offers a valuable contribution to addressing the challenges associated with ML modeling in the presence of missing data by providing a practical solution that achieves high predictive accuracy and model interpretability.","Analyzing user behavior from usability evaluation can be a challenging and time-consuming task, especially as the number of participants and the scale and complexity of the evaluation grows. We propose uxSense, a visual analytics system using machine learning methods to extract user behavior from audio and video recordings as parallel time-stamped data streams. Our implementation draws on pattern recognition, computer vision, natural language processing, and machine learning to extract user sentiment, actions, posture, spoken words, and other features from such recordings. These streams are visualized as parallel timelines in a web-based front-end, enabling the researcher to search, filter, and annotate data across time and space. We present the results of a user study involving professional UX researchers evaluating user data using uxSense. In fact, we used uxSense itself to evaluate their sessions.",,,,"We propose emordle, a conceptual design that animates wordles (compact word clouds) to deliver their emotional context to the audiences. To inform the design, we first reviewed online examples of animated texts and animated wordles, and summarized strategies for injecting emotion into the animations. We introduced a composite approach that extends an existing animation scheme for one word to multiple words in a wordle with two global factors: the randomness of text animation (entropy) and the animation speed (speed). To create an emordle, general users can choose one predefined animated scheme that matches the intended emotion class and fine-tune the emotion intensity with the two parameters. We designed proof-of-concept emordle examples for four basic emotion classes, namely happiness, sadness, anger, and fear. We conducted two controlled crowdsourcing studies to evaluate our approach. The first study confirmed that people generally agreed on the conveyed emotions from well-crafted animations, and the second one demonstrated that our identified factors helped fine-tune the delivered emotion extent. We also invited general users to create emordles on their own based on our proposed framework. Through this user study, we confirmed the effectiveness of the approach. We concluded with implications for future research opportunities of supporting emotion expression in visualizations.","A systematic review (SR) is essential with up-to-date research evidence to support clinical decisions and practices. However, the growing literature volume makes it challenging for SR reviewers and clinicians to discover useful information efficiently. Many human-in-the-loop information retrieval approaches (HIR) have been proposed to rank documents semantically similar to users' queries and provide interactive visualizations to facilitate document retrieval. Given that the queries are mainly composed of keywords and keyphrases retrieving documents that are semantically similar to a query does not necessarily respond to the clinician's need. Clinicians still have to review many documents to find the solution. The problem motivates us to develop a visual analytics system, DocFlow, to facilitate information-seeking. One of the features of our DocFlow is accepting natural language questions. The detailed description enables retrieving documents that can answer users' questions. Additionally, clinicians often categorize documents based on their backgrounds and with different purposes (e.g., populations, treatments). Since the criteria are unknown and cannot be pre-defined in advance, existing methods can only achieve categorization by considering the entire information in documents. In contrast, by locating answers in each document, our DocFlow can intelligently categorize documents based on users' questions. The second feature of our DocFlow is a flexible interface where users can arrange a sequence of questions to customize their rules for document retrieval and categorization. The two features of this visual analytics system support a flexible information-seeking process. The case studies and the feedback from domain experts demonstrate the usefulness and effectiveness of our DocFlow.","Benchmark datasets play an important role in evaluating Natural Language Understanding (NLU) models. However, shortcuts—unwanted biases in the benchmark datasets—can damage the effectiveness of benchmark datasets in revealing models’ real capabilities. Since shortcuts vary in coverage, productivity, and semantic meaning, it is challenging for NLU experts to systematically understand and avoid them when creating benchmark datasets. In this paper, we develop a visual analytics system, ShortcutLens, to help NLU experts explore shortcuts in NLU benchmark datasets. The system allows users to conduct multi-level exploration of shortcuts. Specifically, Statistics View helps users grasp the statistics such as coverage and productivity of shortcuts in the benchmark dataset. Template View employs hierarchical and interpretable templates to summarize different types of shortcuts. Instance View allows users to check the corresponding instances covered by the shortcuts. We conduct case studies and expert interviews to evaluate the effectiveness and usability of the system. The results demonstrate that ShortcutLens supports users in gaining a better understanding of benchmark dataset issues through shortcuts, inspiring them to create challenging and pertinent benchmark datasets.","Natural language interfaces (NLIs) enable users to flexibly specify analytical intentions in data visualization. However, diagnosing the visualization results without understanding the underlying generation process is challenging. Our research explores how to provide explanations for NLIs to help users locate the problems and further revise the queries. We present XNLI, an explainable NLI system for visual data analysis. The system introduces a Provenance Generator to reveal the detailed process of visual transformations, a suite of interactive widgets to support error adjustments, and a Hint Generator to provide query revision hints based on the analysis of user queries and interactions. Two usage scenarios of XNLI and a user study verify the effectiveness and usability of the system. Results suggest that XNLI can significantly enhance task accuracy without interrupting the NLI-based analysis process.",,"Graphical perception studies typically measure visualization encoding effectiveness using the error of an “average observer”, leading to canonical rankings of encodings for numerical attributes: e.g., position > area > angle > volume. Yet different people may vary in their ability to read different visualization types, leading to variance in this ranking across individuals not captured by population-level metrics using “average observer” models. One way we can bridge this gap is by recasting classic visual perception tasks as tools for assessing individual performance, in addition to overall visualization performance. In this paper we replicate and extend Cleveland and McGill’s graphical comparison experiment using Bayesian multilevel regression, using these models to explore individual differences in visualization skill from multiple perspectives. The results from experiments and modeling indicate that some people show patterns of accuracy that credibly deviate from the canonical rankings of visualization effectiveness. We discuss implications of these findings, such as a need for new ways to communicate visualization effectiveness to designers, how patterns in individuals’ responses may show systematic biases and strategies in visualization judgment, and how recasting classic visual perception tasks as tools for assessing individual performance may offer new ways to quantify aspects of visualization literacy. Experiment data, source code, and analysis scripts are available at the following repository: https://osf.io/8ub7t/?view_only=9be4798797404a4397be3c6fc2a68cc0.",,,,,,"Electroactive polymers are frequently used in engineering applications due to their ability to change their shape and properties under the influence of an electric field. This process also works vice versa such that a mechanical deformation of the material induces an electric field in the EAP device. This specific behaviour makes such materials highly attractive for the construction of actuators and sensors in various application areas. The electromechanical behaviour of electroactive polymers can be described by a third-order coupling tensor which represents the sensitivity of mechanical stresses with respect to the electric field, i.e. it establishes a relation between a second-order and a first-order tensor field. Due to the complexity of this coupling tensor and to the lack of meaningful visualization methods for third-order tensors in general, an interpretation of the tensor is rather difficult. Thus, the central engineering research question that this contribution deals with, is a deeper understanding of the electromechanical coupling by analyzing the third-order coupling tensor with the help of specific visualization methods. Starting with a deviatoric decomposition of the tensor, the multipoles of each deviator are visualized, which allows a first insight into this highly complex third-order tensor. In the present contribution, four examples including electromechanical coupling are simulated within a finite element framework and subsequently analyzed by using the tensor visualization method.","We present a novel framework for 3D tomographic reconstruction and visualization of tomograms from noisy electron microscopy tilt-series. Our technique takes as an input aligned tilt-series from cryogenic electron microscopy and creates denoised 3D tomograms using a proximal jointly-optimized approach that iteratively performs reconstruction and denoising, relieving the users of the need to select appropriate denoising algorithms in the pre-reconstruction or post-reconstruction steps. The whole process is accelerated by exploiting parallelism on modern GPUs, and the results can be visualized immediately after the reconstruction using volume rendering tools incorporated in the framework. We show that our technique can be used with multiple combinations of reconstruction algorithms and regularizers, thanks to the flexibility provided by proximal algorithms. Additionally, the reconstruction framework is open-source and can be easily extended with additional reconstruction and denoising methods. Furthermore, our approach enables visualization of reconstruction error throughout the iterative process within the reconstructed tomogram and on projection planes of the input tilt-series. We evaluate our approach in comparison with state-of-the-art approaches and additionally show how our error visualization can be used for reconstruction evaluation.","In volume visualization transfer functions are widely used for mapping voxel properties to color and opacity. Typically, volume density data are scalars which require simple 1D transfer functions to achieve this mapping. If the volume densities are vectors of three channels, one can straightforwardly map each channel to either red, green or blue, which requires a trivial extension of the 1D transfer function editor. We devise a new method that applies to volume data with more than three channels. These types of data often arise in scientific scanning applications, where the data are separated into spectral bands or chemical elements. Our method expands on prior work in which a multivariate information display, RadViz, was fused with a radial color map, in order to visualize multi-band 2D images. In this work, we extend this joint interface to blended volume rendering. The information display allows users to recognize the presence and value distribution of the multivariate voxels and the joint volume rendering display visualizes their spatial distribution. We design a set of operators and lenses that allow users to interactively control the mapping of the multivariate voxels to opacity and color. This enables users to isolate or emphasize volumetric structures with desired multivariate properties. Furthermore, it turns out that our method also enables more insightful displays even for RGB data. We demonstrate our method with three datasets obtained from spectral electron microscopy, high energy X-ray scanning, and atmospheric science.",,,,,"The advent of low-cost, accessible, and high-performance augmented reality (AR) has shed light on a situated form of analytics where in-situ visualizations embedded in the real world can facilitate sensemaking based on the user’s physical location. In this work, we identify prior literature in this emerging field with a focus on the technologies enabling such situated analytics. After collecting 47 relevant situated analytics systems, we classify them using a taxonomy of three dimensions: situating triggers, view situatedness, and data depiction. We then identify four archetypical patterns in our classification using an ensemble cluster analysis. Finally, we discuss several insights and design guidelines that we learned from our analysis.",,,,,,,,"Wildfires affect many regions across the world. The accelerated progression of global warming has amplified their frequency and scale, deepening their impact on human life, the economy, and the environment. The temperature rise has been driving wildfires to behave unpredictably compared to those previously observed, challenging researchers and fire management agencies to understand the factors behind this behavioral change. Furthermore, this change has rendered fire personnel training outdated and lost its ability to adequately prepare personnel to respond to these new fires. Immersive visualization can play a key role in tackling the growing issue of wildfires. Therefore, this survey reviews various studies that use immersive and non-immersive data visualization techniques to depict wildfire behavior and train first responders and planners. This paper identifies the most useful characteristics of these systems. While these studies support knowledge creation for certain situations, there is still scope to comprehensively improve immersive systems to address the unforeseen dynamics of wildfires.","Lineup selection is an essential and important task in soccer matches. To win a match, coaches must consider various factors and select appropriate players for a planned formation. Computation-based tools have been proposed to help coaches on this complex task, but they are usually based on over-simplified models on player performances, do not support interactive analysis, and overlook the inputs by coaches. In this paper, we propose a method for visual analytics of soccer lineup selection by tackling two challenges: characterizing essential factors involved in generating optimal lineup, and supporting coach-driven visual analytics of lineup selection. We develop a lineup selection model that integrates such important factors, such as spatial regions of player actions and defensive interactions with opponent players. A visualization system, Team-Builder, is developed to help coaches control the process of lineup generation, explanation, and comparison through multiple coordinated views. The usefulness and effectiveness of our system are demonstrated by two case studies on a real-world soccer event dataset.",,"Leaving the context of visualizations invisible can have negative impacts on understanding and transparency. While common wisdom suggests that recontextualizing visualizations with metadata (e.g., disclosing the data source or instructions for decoding the visualizations' encoding) may counter these effects, the impact remains largely unknown. To fill this gap, we conducted two experiments. In Experiment 1, we explored how chart type, topic, and user goal impacted which categories of metadata participants deemed most relevant. We presented 64 participants with four real-world visualizations. For each visualization, participants were given four goals and selected the type of metadata they most wanted from a set of 18 types. Our results indicated that participants were most interested in metadata which explained the visualization's encoding for goals related to understanding and metadata about the source of the data for assessing trustworthiness. In Experiment 2, we explored how these two types of metadata impact transparency, trustworthiness and persuasiveness, information relevance, and understanding. We asked 144 participants to explain the main message of two pairs of visualizations (one with metadata and one without); rate them on scales of transparency and relevance; and then predict the likelihood that they were selected for a presentation to policymakers. Our results suggested that visualizations with metadata were perceived as more thorough than those without metadata, but similarly relevant, accurate, clear, and complete. Additionally, we found that metadata did not impact the accuracy of the information extracted from visualizations, but may have influenced which information participants remembered as important or interesting.","Visual stories are an effective and powerful tool to convey specific information to a diverse public. Scrollytelling is a recent visual storytelling technique extensively used on the web, where content appears or changes as users scroll up or down a page. By employing the familiar gesture of scrolling as its primary interaction mechanism, it provides users with a sense of control, exploration and discoverability while still offering a simple and intuitive interface. In this paper, we present a novel approach for authoring, editing, and presenting data-driven scientific narratives using scrollytelling. Our method flexibly integrates common sources such as images, text, and video, but also supports more specialized visualization techniques such as interactive maps as well as scalar field and mesh data visualizations. We show that scrolling navigation can be used to traverse dynamic narratives and demonstrate how it can be combined with interactive parameter exploration. The resulting system consists of an extensible web-based authoring tool capable of exporting stand-alone stories that can be hosted on any web server. We demonstrate the power and utility of our approach with case studies from several diverse scientific fields and with a user study including 12 participants of diverse professional backgrounds. Furthermore, an expert in creating interactive articles assessed the usefulness of our approach and the quality of the created stories.",,,,,"Current work on using visual analytics to determine causal relations among variables has mostly been based on the concept of counterfactuals. As such the derived static causal networks do not take into account the effect of time as an indicator. However, knowing the time delay of a causal relation can be crucial as it instructs how and when actions should be taken. Yet, similar to static causality, deriving causal relations from observational time-series data, as opposed to designed experiments, is not a straightforward process. It can greatly benefit from human insight to break ties and resolve errors.  We hence propose a set of visual analytics methods that allow humans to participate in the discovery of causal relations associated with windows of time delay. Specifically, we leverage a well-established method, logic-based causality, to enable analysts to test the significance of potential causes and measure their influences toward a certain effect. Furthermore, since an effect can be a cause of other effects, we allow users to  aggregate different temporal cause-effect relations found with our method into a visual flow diagram to enable the discovery of temporal causal networks. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods we constructed a prototype system named DOMINO and showcase it via a number of case studies using real-world datasets. Finally, we also used DOMINO to conduct several evaluations with human analysts from different science domains in order to gain feedback on the utility of our system in practical scenarios.",,,,,,"This paper introduces an efficient algorithm for persistence diagram computation, given an input piecewise linear scalar field f defined on a d-dimensional simplicial complex K, with $d \leq 3$. Our work revisits the seminal algorithm ""PairSimplices"" [31], [103] with discrete Morse theory (DMT) [34], [80], which greatly reduces the number of input simplices to consider. Further, we also extend to DMT and accelerate the stratification strategy described in ""PairSimplices"" for the fast computation of the 0th and (d - 1)th diagrams, noted $D_0(f)$ and $D_{d-1}(f)$. Minima-saddle persistence pairs ($D_0(f)$) and saddle-maximum persistence pairs ($D_{d-1}(f)$) are efficiently computed by processing, with a Union-Find, the unstable sets of 1-saddles and the stable sets of (d - 1)-saddles. This fast pre-computation for the dimensions 0 and (d - 1) enables an aggressive specialization of [4] to the 3D case, which results in a drastic reduction of the number of input simplices for the computation of $D_1(f)$, the intermediate layer of the sandwich. Finally, we document several performance improvements via shared-memory parallelism. We provide an open-source implementation of our algorithm for reproducibility purposes. We also contribute a reproducible benchmark package, which exploits three-dimensional data from a public repository and compares our algorithm to a variety of publicly available implementations. Extensive experiments indicate that our algorithm improves by two orders of magnitude the time performance of the seminal ""PairSimplices"" algorithm it extends. Moreover, it also improves memory footprint and time performance over a selection of 14 competing approaches, with a substantial gain over the fastest available approaches, while producing a strictly identical output.","This paper presents a well-scaling parallel algorithm for the computation of Morse-Smale (MS) segmentations, including the region separators and region boundaries. The segmentation of the domain into ascending and descending manifolds, solely defined on the vertices, improves the computational time using path compression and fully segments the border region. Region boundaries and region separators are generated using a multi-label marching tetrahedra algorithm. This enables a fast and simple solution to find optimal parameter settings in preliminary exploration steps by generating an MS complex preview. It also poses a rapid option to generate a fast visual representation of the region geometries for immediate utilization. Two experiments demonstrate the performance of our approach with speedups of over an order of magnitude in comparison to two publicly available implementations. The example section shows the similarity to the MS complex, the useability of the approach, and the benefits of this method with respect to the presented datasets. We provide our implementation with the paper.","This paper presents a computational framework for the Principal Geodesic Analysis of merge trees (MT-PGA), a novel adaptation of the celebrated Principal Component Analysis (PCA) framework [87] to the Wasserstein metric space of merge trees [92]. We formulate MT-PGA computation as a constrained optimization problem, aiming at adjusting a basis of orthogonal geodesic axes, while minimizing a fitting energy. We introduce an efficient, iterative algorithm which exploits shared-memory parallelism, as well as an analytic expression of the fitting energy gradient, to ensure fast iterations. Our approach also trivially extends to extremum persistence diagrams. Extensive experiments on public ensembles demonstrate the efficiency of our approach - with MT-PGA computations in the orders of minutes for the largest examples. We show the utility of our contributions by extending to merge trees two typical PCA applications. First, we apply MT-PGA to data reduction and reliably compress merge trees by concisely representing them by their first coordinates in the MT-PGA basis. Second, we present a dimensionality reduction framework exploiting the first two directions of the MT-PGA basis to generate two-dimensional layouts of the ensemble. We augment these layouts with persistence correlation views, enabling global and local visual inspections of the feature variability in the ensemble. In both applications, quantitative experiments assess the relevance of our framework. Finally, we provide a C++ implementation that can be used to reproduce our results.",,,,,,,,,,"A viewer’s existing beliefs can prevent accurate reasoning with data visualizations. In particular, confirmation bias can cause people to overweigh information that confirms their beliefs, and dismiss information that disconfirms them. We tested whether confirmation bias exists when people reason with visualized data and whether certain visualization designs can elicit less biased reasoning strategies. We asked crowd workers to solve reasoning problems that had the potential to evoke both poor reasoning strategies and confirmation bias. We created two scenarios, one in which we primed people with a belief before asking them to make a decision, and another in which people held pre-existing beliefs. The data was presented as either a table, a bar table, or a bar chart. To correctly solve the problem, participants should use a complex reasoning strategy to compare two ratios, each between two pairs of values. But participants could also be tempted to use simpler, superficial heuristics, shortcuts, or biased strategies to reason about the problem. Presenting the data in a table format helped participants reason with the correct ratio strategy while showing the data as a bar table or a bar chart led participants towards incorrect heuristics. Confirmation bias was not significantly present when beliefs were primed, but it was present when beliefs were pre-existing. Additionally, the table presentation format was more likely to afford the ratio reasoning strategy, and the use of the ratio strategy was more likely to lead to the correct answer. These findings suggest that data presentation formats can affect affordances for reasoning.",,,,,,"Presenting a predictive model's performance is a communication bottleneck that threatens collaborations between data scientists and subject matter experts.  Accuracy and error metrics alone fail to tell the whole story of a model – its risks, strengths, and limitations – making it difficult for subject matter experts to feel confident in their decision to use a model.  As a result, models may fail in unexpected ways or go entirely unused, as subject matter experts disregard poorly presented models in favor of familiar, yet arguably substandard methods.  In this paper, we describe an iterative study conducted with both subject matter experts and data scientists to understand the gaps in communication between these two groups.  We find that, while the two groups share common goals of understanding the data and predictions of the model, friction can stem from unfamiliar terms, metrics, and visualizations – limiting the transfer of knowledge to SMEs and discouraging clarifying questions being asked during presentations.  Based on our findings, we derive a set of communication guidelines that use visualization as a common medium for communicating the strengths and weaknesses of a model.  We provide a demonstration of our guidelines in a regression modeling scenario and elicit feedback on their use from subject matter experts.  From our demonstration, subject matter experts were more comfortable discussing a model's performance, more aware of the trade-offs for the presented model, and better equipped to assess the model's risks – ultimately informing and contextualizing the model's use beyond text and numbers.",,,,,,,"In recent years, visual analytics (VA) has shown promise in alleviating the challenges of interpreting black-box deep learning (DL) models. While the focus of VA for explainable DL has been mainly on classification problems, DL is gaining popularity in high-dimensional-to-high-dimensional (H-H) problems such as image-to-image translation. In contrast to classification, H-H problems have no explicit instance groups or classes to study. Each output is continuous, high-dimensional, and changes in an unknown non-linear manner with changes in the input. These unknown relations between the input, model and output necessitate the user to analyze them in conjunction, leveraging symmetries between them. Since classification tasks do not exhibit some of these challenges, most existing VA systems and frameworks allow limited control of the components required to analyze models beyond classification. Hence, we identify the need for and present a unified conceptual framework, the Transform-and-Perform framework (T&P), to facilitate the design of VA systems for DL model analysis focusing on H-H problems. T&P provides a checklist to structure and identify workflows and analysis strategies to design new VA systems, and understand existing ones to uncover potential gaps for improvements. The goal is to aid the creation of effective VA systems that support the structuring of model understanding and identifying actionable insights for model improvements. We highlight the growing need for new frameworks like T&P with a real-world image-to image translation application. We illustrate how T&P effectively supports the understanding and identification of potential gaps in existing VA systems.","One of the potential solutions for model interpretation is to train a surrogate model: a more transparent model that approximates the behavior of the model to be explained. Typically, classification rules or decision trees are used due to their logic-based expressions. However, decision trees can grow too deep, and rule sets can become too large to approximate a complex model. Unlike paths on a decision tree that must share ancestor nodes (conditions), rules are more flexible. However, the unstructured visual representation of rules makes it hard to make inferences across rules. In this paper, we focus on tabular data and present novel algorithmic and interactive solutions to address these issues. First, we present Hierarchical Surrogate Rules (HSR), an algorithm that generates hierarchical rules based on user-defined parameters. We also contribute SURE, a visual analytics (VA) system that integrates HSR and an interactive surrogate rule visualization, the Feature-Aligned Tree, which depicts rules as trees while aligning features for easier comparison. We evaluate the algorithm in terms of parameter sensitivity, time performance, and comparison with surrogate decision trees and find that it scales reasonably well and overcomes the shortcomings of surrogate decision trees. We evaluate the visualization and the system through a usability study and an observational study with domain experts. Our investigation shows that the participants can use feature-aligned trees to perform non-trivial tasks with very high accuracy. We also discuss many interesting findings, including a rule analysis task characterization, that can be used for visualization design and future research.",,,,"Despite its importance for assessing the effectiveness of communicating information visually, fine-grained recallability of information visualisations has not been studied quantitatively so far. In this work, we propose a question-answering paradigm to study visualisation recallability and present VisRecall - a novel dataset consisting of 200 visualisations that are annotated with crowd-sourced human (N = 305) recallability scores obtained from 1,000 questions of five question types. Furthermore, we present the first computational method to predict recallability of different visualisation elements, such as the title or specific data values. We report detailed analyses of our method on VisRecall and demonstrate that it outperforms several baselines in overall recallability and FE-, F-, RV-, and U-question recallability. Our work makes fundamental contributions towards a new generation of methods to assist designers in optimising visualisations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"This project aims to transform the nano-scale of a striking biological phenomenon, the relationship between the SARS-CoV-2 virus and human molecules, into an interactive audiovisual simulation. In this work, Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) touching and imaging a single molecule measures the interaction between the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and human cellular proteins and measures the dynamic of the spike protein. We create a comprehensive scientific model based on diverse datasets and theories presenting a real-time interactive complex system with efficient rendering and sonification using a single C++ platform. This project invites the audience into an immersive space where they can control the behavior of biomolecules, allowing them to intuitively perceive biological properties. This project is not only a demonstration of scientific data but also attempts to look at the interspecies relationship in parasitism which particularly deals with our current and post-pandemic life with coronavirus and how we might control our coexistence in a virtual space. By envisioning coexistence strategies in a virtual space, the project challenges dominant narratives, explores alternative ways to navigate the pandemic's complex dimensions, and serves as a catalyst for dialogue among a diverse audience.","Body Cosmos is an immersive and interactive artwork that connects the human body with the cosmic environment through real-time bio-data. Using volumetric rendering and particle system, we create a surreal virtual reality that reflects the intricate structures of human anatomy and celestial nebulae. We integrate heart rate monitors and EEG devices to capture and process bio-data into emotion indicators, which influence the visualization of particle movements in the artwork. This creates an intimate, personal connection with the cosmos, transcending immediate presence and nurturing a perpetual presence within the cosmic expanse. We also provide two engagement modes: Roller Coaster Mode and Free Explore Mode, allowing different levels of exploration. Body Cosmos is more than a visual spectacle; it sparks curiosity, expands the imagination, and enhances awareness of our embodied and cosmic identity.","Spotlight is an interactive book on the topic of government-imposed internet shutdowns. This data visualization project explores the effects of internet shutdowns and some of the common reasons they occur, as well as their relation to sensitive events such as protests and elections. The book is made interactive through the use of glow-in-the-dark paint in multiple interactive activities and visualizations, which requires the viewer to use a UV flashlight provided to them on the first page of the book to reveal additional information. For the purposes of this exhibition, the 10 pages of the book are individually placed on a wall in a linear fashion, each with their own UV flashlight. The viewers are able to interact with each page by going through a tunnel-shaped space created by placing a dark curtain from the ceiling in front of the wall. The book itself is placed outside, at the entrance of this tunnel, for display. The overall experience aims to replicate living through an internet shutdown by placing readers of the interactive book in a low-light environment and providing them with a flashlight in order to shine light on information and data that does not easily reach many people due to a lack of internet access.","The artwork visualises the momentary shape of a wave in perfect shape, ideal for surfing, which retains its aesthetics forever, by mixing reality and virtual reality. By presenting it, the flexible cognitive abilities of the audience who sees it continue to work to actively select beautiful experiences and create a better future. The work reaffirms the supple strength of human cognitive abilities and expresses a sense of human existence that will remain unchanged forever, even in a future where reality is in chaos.","This generative work draws data from 2,499 queer independent games for about 12 seconds each. Each game adds a unique shape and colour onto the canvas, and plays a unique string of notes. Over 8 hours, the canvas will be filled with infinite colours to celebrate LGBTQIA+ independent videogames. History has always been queer. Through this generative visual and sound work, we aim to demonstrate the collective activism, movement, and creative expressions that queer folks are making to be visible, heard, and to say that we are here.  But queer movement does not happen over night; queer resistance is accumulative and built over generations of self-sacrifice and self-acceptance. The multitude intersectionality of the unruly times slowly bleeds colour into the world, blends motion into the landscape, and accumulatively becomes a canvas of ever-moving colourful light.","Loneliness and isolation are eternal emotions in human beings. Technological advancements create ample avenues, like social medias, for individuals to articulate themselves and record emotions. However, the sense of loneliness has never vanished, as their expressions are easily buried in the digital stream. We analyze tweets that express loneliness during holiday seasons but receive few responses. By superimposing digital charts on physical models, we visualize these lonely posts and generate the island of loneliness. We aim to reveal the complexities of human emotions in the digital age and reflect on the interconnections between technology, solitude, and social communication.","Solar System is an audio-visual live performance that marries data visualization and sonification. The installation system employs sidereal period data from the eight planets in our Solar System to generate a live soundtrack and visualization. The mission of this endeavor is to use audible and visual media to allow humans to uncover and cognize with the always surrounding, yet invisible, Solar System. Each planet's unique data patterns (sidereal periods) contribute to this exploration by being translated with audible and visible media. The media stimulate audiences' cognitive senses, enabling audiences to tangibly experience the aesthetic wonder of the cosmic world, which is deeply interconnected with the entirety of the Universe and humanity on Earth. The inspiration and message of the Solar System project resonate with this year's theme, Perpetual Presence. Throughout history, data from the Universe has been employed to uncover the existence of unseen worlds, the Cosmos. The discoveries gleaned from the process have influenced numerous sectors of our humanity, communicated through a multitude of languages and approaches. Scientists use numerical data and textual explanations to communicate information about the Cosmos. On the other hand, artists use sensory media, such as visuals and sounds, to narrate the story of the Cosmos. This art project aims to manifest the continuous and timeless presence of the Universe where it surrounds humanity, employing artistic transformation of universe data to illuminate its enduring existence.","Eco-Mending juxtaposes old and new to tell a story of ecological regeneration. We find stories of human-mediated restoration in longitudinal data, and stitch modern data into imagery from the past, creating decorative wall and ceiling hangings. With perpetuality of data, comes the possibility of changing it. In this collection of art pieces, we pair past ecological destruction with present and future projections of data that highlight successful ecological reconstructions","Latent Prism is a visually captivating and thought-provoking piece that incorporates artificial intelligence (AI) and data visualization. It presents a projection of an imagined environment, created through a generative adversarial network (GAN) trained on thousands of aerial photographs from royalty-free stock photo websites. The sculpture takes the form of a polished transparent lucite prism, within which layers of translucent mylar film are suspended. These films display frames extracted from an AI-generated video known as a “latent walk,” showcasing undulating ocean and forest landscapes captured from an aerial perspective. Frames are selected at regular intervals along the linear interpolation of images from the generative model, such that light from below is still able to permeate up to the viewer. The aggregated effect of these layered video frames results in an eerie visual sensation of peering down at a forested landscape that is being submerged in water. Surrounding the prism is a haphazardly piled 120ft. (36.5m)-long roll of credits, listing the names and photographers for every image used to train the model on a 2.5in (6.35cm) wide strip of drafting paper.","In the novel The Vast Territory (El vasto territorio. Alfaguara, 2021; Caja Negra, 2023), by Chilean author Simón López Trujillo, a mycologist analyzes the way a certain fungus infects the mind of a forest worker called Pedro. In one moment, an abstract image, of countless white dots against a black background, in the form of waves or a mountain range, appears to explain the infection: the genetic origin of the language of Pedro, when the fungus starts speaking through him.  That image, included in the revised edition of the book, is also a depiction of the novel’s genetic origin, as it was generated by a visualization of different drafts of the novel. In every literary reading, two texts are involved: the written or actual text, that we can smoothly read with our eyes, and a second text, imperceptible and invisible, made of all the deletions, editions, and additions of words involved in the process of writing the text. This project conceives the visualization of The Vast Territory as a visual novel on its own that explores the unconscious of the book: that black, secret space, where the words involved during the writing process emerge as ghostly presences. There, the data of the previous draft are manifested in the following one, as a latent presence in the actuality of the text we read. The work, where every white dot represents a word in the juxtaposed draft sequence, is a two-dimensional pixel-based text visualization. Its construction follows only two straightforward rules: (1) words are sequentially arranged in a horizontal line; (2) the vertical position of each word-dot is determined by its initial appearance within the entire sequence of drafts. The result is a “data-palimpsest” where each draft leaves its imprint on the next through their cumulative determination of the spatial order. By using the order of first appearance as the guiding principle, the visualization emphasizes the inherited structure of each draft from its predecessors, akin to looking at the fossil record or geological strata, with the most ancient elements appearing at the greatest depth. The layer on top, where the words are shown, allows the viewer to inspect the content at each point in time, which is indicated by a thin vertical line or by the “folding” of the canvas. It acts as a zoom-in, where the overlaid words are placed at their precise height in the visualization, or first-appearance depth.","The work presented here are artistic endeavors tightly integrating topics of current climate research, contextual imagery referring to that research, data visualizations of a coupled climate model, and drawings weaving the art and the science into one, all in the service of the accelerating levels of carbon and methane altering and amplifying weather patterns, slowing oceanic currents, and fundamentally altering the habitability of our planet.","The data sculpture ""Monster in a Snowglobe"" offers a distant reading perspective on the life and work of the Austrian painter Herwig Zens (1943-2019). The 3D-printed artifact assembles major steps and movements of the artist's biography as an annotated trajectory in space and time. Its data selection draws both from biographical knowledge and from autobiographical entries in a unique diary, which the artist etched into a sequence of copper plates during his lifetime. A complete print of the diary—also referred to as “monster” due to its procedural and perceptual complexity—is considered the longest etching in the world at 40 meters and was partially presented at the Museum of Art History in Vienna in Spring 2023. In this context, the data sculpture reframed the ephemeral complexity of a modern path of life as a material mimicry and instance of perpetual presence in an object-oriented exhibition environment.","“Plastic Landscape - The Reversible World” is an AI-generated 3D animated video design that shows the apocalyptic and surreal world surrounded by artificial plastic mixtures and objects in the ocean, urban city, Antarctica, and forest. Four different scenes are animated, with the camera panning slowly from left to right. Viewers can observe how the plastics are decomposed at a slower speed by looking at particle animations. Sound is created by the data of the decomposition of plastics. Different types of plastics and speed of decomposition determine the frequency, amplitude, and parameters of audio synthesis. This scene animation is inspired by Ilwalobongbyeong (a folding screen) behind the king’s throne of the Joseon Dynasty. This animation depicts the twist of the landscape. Surreal objects/buildings in this animation made out of plastic look beautiful and mesmerizing at first glance. However, the viewers can notice that they are the decayed objects and destroyed nature impacted by human beings. This new multi-sensory artwork addresses the awareness of plastic pollution through the apocalyptic lens.","This project aims to transform the nano-scale of a striking biological phenomenon, the relationship between the SARS-CoV-2 virus and human molecules, into an interactive audiovisual simulation.

We’ve mapped distress data quantity to the bitterness and color of tea through data analysis and experimentation. Participants taste, smell, and observe 11 cups of tea, each embodying a year’s distress data, in our workshop. Their facial expressions, recorded upon tasting, visually indicate emotional states. This project explores benefits and pragmatic solutions to challenges of data edibilization.","This paper presents ""Body Cosmos"", an artwork that creates a symbiotic relationship between the human body and a simulated cosmic environment through volumetric rendering and particle system. Drawing from DICOM data to simulate the human body and nebulae, we create an interactive and dynamic virtual environment. The real-time bio-data of users, collected via heart rate sensors and EEG devices, is integrated into the visualization, fostering a personal engagement and unity within this 'cosmos.' Body Cosmos provokes curiosity and expands users' imagination, and deepens their understanding of life's macrocosm and microcosm. This exploratory project redefines traditional perceptions of the human body in relation to the universe, creating a unique lens to view selfhood, embodiment, and identity. As we look to the future, the system's evolution will include incorporation of more bio-data sensors, an investigation into its potential psychological and physiological benefits, and the development of social interactive features through multi-user capabilities.","Loneliness and isolation are eternal emotions in human beings.

Artists created a book that explored the idea of organic and machine-made interpretations of a place that were generate using 3 different processes: a generative adversarial network, traditional printmaking and a camera. The artists found the results unexpected, discussing how the AI-generated image changed and complicated their understanding and constructed narrative about the original image and space. This caused them to think outside the box with over half of the students changing their print matrix and/or ink choices after seeing their AI-generated image. This supported the learning objective for students to collaborate with technology that is uninhibited by perspective or expectation, adapting and responding productively and creatively within a new framework. With the newfound accessibility to AI-generated images we encourage art teachers to explore how it fits into their curriculum.","We are perpetually present in our environment, experiencing it with our senses. Scientific data describes the same environment quantitatively. Our goal is to use scientific and artistic methods to combine these environmental expressions and personal experience through the creation of glyphs visually abstracted from and associated with forms in nature in the representation of climate data. The use of these glyphs removes the distinctions between scientific data and sensory experience, to allow a fuller intuitive association between the two, creating an embodied experience and increasing awareness of the climate effects and changes all around us.","The emergence of large-scale AI models, like GPT-4, has significantly impacted academia and industry, driving the demand for high-performance computing (HPC) to accelerate workloads. To address this, we present HPCClusterScape, a visualization system that enhances the efficiency and transparency of shared HPC clusters for large-scale AI models. HPCClusterScape provides a comprehensive overview of system-level (e.g., partitions, hosts, and workload status) and application-level (e.g., identification of experiments and researchers) information, allowing HPC operators and machine learning researchers to monitor resource utilization and identify issues through customizable violation rules. The system includes diagnostic tools to investigate workload imbalances and synchronization bottlenecks in large-scale distributed deep learning experiments. Deployed in industrial-scale HPC clusters, HPCClusterScape incorporates user feedback and meets specific requirements. This paper outlines the challenges and prerequisites for efficient HPC operation, introduces the interactive visualization system, and highlights its contributions in addressing pain points and optimizing resource utilization in shared HPC clusters.","Understanding how local environments influence individual behaviors, such as voting patterns or suicidal tendencies, is crucial in social science to reveal and reduce spatial disparities and promote social well-being. With the increasing availability of large-scale individual-level census data, new analytical opportunities arise for social scientists to explore human behaviors (e.g., political engagement) among social groups at a fine-grained level. However, traditional statistical methods mostly focus on global, aggregated spatial correlations, which are limited to understanding and comparing the impact of local environments (e.g., neighborhoods) on human behaviors among social groups.  In this study, we introduce a new analytical framework for analyzing multi-variate neighborhood effects between social groups. We then propose NeighViz, an interactive visual analytics system that helps social scientists explore, understand, and verify the influence of neighborhood effects on human behaviors. Finally, we use a case study to illustrate the effectiveness and usability of our system.","Debugging programs is famously one of the most challenging aspects of programming. Data analysis scripts present additional challenges as debugging tasks are often more exploratory, such as comparing results under different parameter settings. In fact, a common exploratory debugging process is to run, modify, and re-run a script to observe the effects of the change. Analyst’s perform this process repeatedly as they explore different settings in their script. However, traditional debugging methods do not support direct comparison across script executions. To address this, we present Aardvark, a comparative trace-based debugging method for identifying and visualizing the differences between consecutive executions of analysis scripts. Aardvark traces two consecutive instances of a script, identifies the differences between them, and presents them through comparative visualizations. We present a prototype implementation in Python along with an extension to Jupyter notebooks and  demonstrate Aardvark through two usage scenarios on real world analysis scripts.","Despite their ubiquity, authoring dashboards for metrics reporting in modern data analysis tools remains a manual, time-consuming process. Rather than focusing on interesting combinations of their data, users have to spend time creating each chart in a dashboard one by one. This makes dashboard creation slow and tedious. We conducted a review of production metrics dashboards and found that many dashboards contain a common structure: breaking down one or more metrics by different dimensions. In response, we developed a high-level specification for describing dashboards as sections of metrics repeated across the same dimensions and a graphical interface, Quick Dashboard, for authoring dashboards based on this specification. We present several usage examples that demonstrate the flexibility of this specification to create various kinds of dashboards and support a data-first approach to dashboard authoring","Causal language models have emerged as the leading technology for automating text generation tasks. Although these models tend to produce outputs that resemble human writing, they still suffer from quality issues (e.g., social biases). Researchers typically use automatic analysis methods to evaluate the model limitations, such as statistics on stereotypical words. Since different types of issues are embedded in the model parameters, the development of automated methods that capture all relevant aspects remains a challenge. To tackle this challenge, we propose a visual analytics approach that supports the exploratory analysis of text sequences generated by causal language models. Our approach enables users to specify starting prompts and effectively groups the resulting text sequences. To this end, we leverage a unified, ontology-driven embedding space, serving as a shared foundation for the thematic concepts present in the generated text sequences. Visual summaries provide insights into various levels of granularity within the generated data. Among others, we propose a novel comparison visualization that slices the embedding space and represents the differences between two prompt outputs in a radial layout. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through case studies, showcasing its potential to reveal model biases and other quality issues.","The Stitch in Time project extends a traditional browser-based visualisation, the LifeLines, by creating physical data embroideries from a subset of the data. The LifeLines visualise the individual life courses of over 13.600 nineteenth century Australian convict women, according to their paper trail left behind in the Colonial Archives. In this project we created 18 embroideries of 21 convict women, based on a sketch inspired by a specific bit of information in the woman's life, and then integrating the data of her lifeline into the embroidery. This way we use a novel approach to show convict women, of whom little imagery has survived. By exhibiting the embroideries in the Penitentiary Chapel in Hobart, Tasmania, we hope to arouse interest in the largely forgotten lives of this first coerced generation of European settlers. We use the unusual medium of embroidery on fabric because they both are tightly connected to the daily experiences of convict women. This way, we hope to create new access points to historical data by extending traditional data visualisation using this specific form of data physicalisation.","Despite the widely held belief that public discourse shapes and informs public policy, tracking and analysing the dynamics of public discourse over long time-frames remains a significant challenge. Myriad factors such as editorial policies, news sensationalism, election cycles, societal priorities, and political agendas can all impact the attention given, and treatment of, a range of important societal issues such as systematic disadvantage. Here, we introduce and describe `Discourse of the Past', an interactive visualisation created for both public touch-screen exhibition and online. The visualisation presents an AI-assisted analysis of hundreds of thousands of op-ed news articles and speeches from the major Australian mastheads and federal parliament respectively. By focusing on 23 population groups and 33 issues, we provide a rich, dynamic picture of how disadvantage is experienced in Australia and by whom. Users can discover a series of findings, such as: how News and Parliament have their own agenda and how each changes its focus over time; how some issues are more recurrent than others; how coverage and discourse intensity change relative to cycles and events; and how both discourses contribute to a better understanding of how disadvantage is lived in Australia.","Stories are as old as human history–-and a powerful means for the engaging communication of information, especially in combination with visualizations. The InTaVia project is built on this intersection and has developed a platform which supports the workflow of cultural heritage experts to create compelling visualization-based stories: From the search for relevant cultural objects and actors in a cultural knowledge graph, to the curation and visual analysis of the selected information, and to the creation of stories based on these data and visualizations, which can be shared with the interested public.","Node-link diagrams are a popular method for representing graphs that capture relationships between individuals, businesses, proteins, and telecommunication endpoints. However, node-link diagrams may fail to convey insights regarding graph structures, even for moderately sized data of a few hundred nodes, due to visual clutter. We propose to apply the mapper construction---a popular tool in topological data analysis---to graph visualization, which provides a strong theoretical basis for summarizing the data while preserving their core structures. We develop a variation of the mapper construction targeting weighted, undirected graphs, called mapper on graphs, which generates homology-preserving skeletons of graphs. We further show how the adjustment of a single parameter enables multi-scale skeletonization of the input graph. We provide a software tool that enables interactive explorations of such skeletons and demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for synthetic and real-world data.","Symmetry is ubiquitous throughout nature and can often give great insights into the formation, structure and stability of objects studied by mathematicians, physicists, chemists and biologists. However, perfect symmetry occurs rarely so quantitative techniques must be developed to identify approximate symmetries. To facilitate the analysis of an independent variable on the symmetry of some object, we would like this quantity to be a smoothly varying real parameter rather than a boolean one. The extended persistent homology transform is a recently developed tool which can be used to define a distance between certain kinds of objects. Here, we describe  how the extended persistent homology transform can be used to visualise, detect and quantify certain kinds of symmetry and discuss the effectiveness and limitations of this method.","This paper presents the first approach to visualize the importance of topological features that define classes of data. Topological features, with their ability to abstract the fundamental structure of complex data, are an integral component of visualization and analysis pipelines. Although not all topological features present in data are of equal importance. To date, the default definition of feature importance is often assumed and fixed. This work shows how proven explainable deep learning approaches can be adapted for use in topological classification. In doing so, it provides the first technique that illuminates what topological structures are important in each dataset in regards to their class label. In particular, the approach uses a learned metric classifier with a density estimator of the points of a persistence diagram as input. This metric learns how to reweigh this density such that classification accuracy is high. By extracting this weight, an importance field on persistent point density can be created. This provides an intuitive representation of persistence point importance that can be used to drive new visualizations. This work provides two examples: Visualization on each diagram directly and, in the case of sublevel set filtrations on images, directly on the images themselves. This work highlights real-world examples of this approach visualizing the important topological features in graph, 3D shape, and medical image data.","Comparative analysis of scalar fields in scientific visualization often involves distance functions on topological abstractions. This paper focuses on the merge tree abstraction (representing the nesting of sub- or superlevel sets) and proposes the application of the unconstrained deformation-based edit distance. Previous approaches on merge trees often suffer from instability: small perturbations in the data can lead to large distances of the abstractions. While some existing methods can handle so-called vertical instability, the unconstrained deformation-based edit distance addresses both vertical and horizontal instabilities, also called saddle swaps. We establish the computational complexity as NP-complete, and provide an integer linear program formulation for computation. Experimental results on the TOSCA shape matching ensemble provide evidence for the stability of the proposed distance. We thereby showcase the potential of handling saddle swaps for comparison of scalar fields through merge trees.","Critical points mark locations in the domain where the level-set topology of a scalar function undergoes fundamental changes and thus indicate potentially interesting features in the data. Established methods exist to locate and relate such points in a deterministic setting, but it is less well understood how the concept of critical points can be extended to the analysis of uncertain data. Most methods for this task aim at finding likely locations of critical points or estimate the probability of their occurrence locally but do not indicate if critical points at potentially different locations in different realizations of a stochastic process are manifestations of the same feature, which is required to characterize the spatial uncertainty of critical points. Previous work on relating critical points across different realizations reported challenges for interpreting the resulting spatial distribution of critical points but did not investigate the causes. In this work, we provide a mathematical formulation of the problem of finding critical points with spatial uncertainty and computing their spatial distribution, which leads us to the notion of uncertain critical points. We analyze the theoretical properties of these structures and highlight connections to existing works for special classes of uncertain fields. We derive conditions under which well-interpretable results can be obtained and discuss the implications of those restrictions for the field of visualization. We demonstrate that the discussed limitations are not purely academic but also arise in real-world data.","Feature tracking is a common task in visualization applications, where methods based on topological data analysis (TDA) have successfully been applied in the past for feature definition as well as tracking. In this work, we focus on tracking extrema of temporal scalar fields. A family of TDA approaches address this task by establishing one-to-one correspondences between extrema based on discrete gradient vector fields. More specifically, two extrema of subsequent time steps are matched if they fall into their respective ascending and descending manifolds. However, due to this one-to-one assignment, these approaches are prone to fail where, e.g., extrema are located in regions with low gradient magnitude, or are located close to boundaries of the manifolds. Therefore, we propose a probabilistic matching that captures a larger set of possible correspondences via neighborhood sampling, or by computing the overlap of the manifolds. We illustrate the usefulness of the approach with two application cases.","Merge trees are a type of topological descriptors that record the connectivity among the sublevel sets of scalar fields. They are among the most widely used topological tools in visualization. In this paper, we are interested in sketching a set of merge trees using techniques from matrix sketching. That is, given a large set T of merge trees, we would like to find a much smaller set of basis trees S such that each tree in T can be approximately reconstructed from a linear combination of merge trees in S. A set of high-dimensional vectors can be approximated via matrix sketching techniques such as principal component analysis and column subset selection. However, until now, there has not been any work on sketching a set of merge trees. We develop a framework for sketching a set of merge trees that combines matrix sketching with tools from optimal transport. In particular, we vectorize a set of merge trees into high-dimensional vectors while preserving their structures and structural relations. We demonstrate the applications of our framework in sketching merge trees that arise from time-varying scientific simulations. Specifically, our framework obtains a set of basis trees as representatives that capture the “modes” of physical phenomena for downstream analysis and visualization.","The mapper graph is a popular tool from topological data analysis that provides a graphical summary of point cloud data. It has been used to study data from cancer research, sports analytics, neurosciences, and machine learning. In particular, mapper graphs have been used recently to visualize the topology of high-dimensional artificial neural activations from convolutional neural networks and large language models. However, a key question that arises from using mapper graphs across applications is how to compare mapper graphs to study their structural differences. In this paper, we introduce a distance between mapper graphs using tools from optimal transport. We demonstrate the utility of such a distance by studying the topological changes of neural activations across convolutional layers in deep learning, as well as by capturing the loss of structural information for a multiscale mapper.","In this work, we propose trait-based merge trees a generalization of merge trees to feature level sets, targeting the analysis of tensor field or general multi-variate data. For this, we employ the notion of traits defined in attribute space as introduced in the feature level sets framework. The resulting distance field in attribute space induces a scalar field in the spatial domain that serves as input for topological data analysis. The leaves in the merge tree represent those areas in the input data that are closest to the defined trait and thus most closely resemble the defined feature. Hence, the merge tree yields a hierarchy of features that allows for querying the most relevant and persistent features. The presented method includes different query methods for the tree which enable the highlighting of different aspects. We demonstrate the cross-application capabilities of this approach with three case studies from different domains.","In this paper, we are interested in the characterization and classification of Morse–Smale functions. To that end, we present MSF Designer, an interactive visualization tool that supports the combinatorial exploration of Morse–Smale functions on the sphere. Our tool supports the design and visualization of a Morse–Smale function in a simple way using fundamental moves, which are combinatorial operations introduced by Catanzaro et al. that modify the Morse–Smale graph of the function. It also provides fine-grained control over the geometry and topology of its gradient vector field. The tool is designed to help mathematicians explore the complex configuration spaces of Morse–Smale functions, as well as their associated gradient vector fields and Morse–Smale complexes. Understanding these spaces will help mathematicians expand their applicability in topological data analysis and visualization. In particular, our tool helps topologists, geometers, and combinatorialists explore invariants in the classification of vector fields and characterize Morse functions in the persistent homology setting.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"We investigated data embroidery with black-and-white textures, identifying challenges in the use of textures for machine embroidery based on our own experience. Data embroidery, as a method of physically representing data, offers a unique way to integrate personal data into one's everyday objects. Owing to their monochromatic characteristics, black-and-white textures promise to be easy to use in machine embroidery. We experimented with different textured visualizations designed by experts, and in this article, we detail our workflow and evaluate the performance and suitability of different textures. We then conducted a survey on vegetable preferences within a family and made a canvas bag featuring the embroidered family data to show how embroidered data can be used in practice.",,,"The IEEE VIS Conference (or VIS) hosts more than 1000 people annually. It brings together visualization researchers and practitioners from across the world to share new research and knowledge. Behind the scenes, a team of volunteers puts together the entire conference and makes sure it runs smoothly. Organizing involves logistics of the conference, ensuring that the attendees have an enjoyable time, allocating rooms to multiple concurrent tracks, and keeping the conference within budget. In recent years, the COVID-19 pandemic has abruptly disrupted plans, forcing organizers to switch to virtual, hybrid, and satellite formats. These alternatives offer many benefits: fewer costs (e.g., travel, venue, institutional), greater accessibility (who can physically travel, who can get visas, who can get child care), and a lower carbon footprint (as people do not need to fly to attend). As many conferences begin to revert to the pre-pandemic status quo of primarily in-person conferences, we suggest that it is an opportune moment to reflect on the benefits and drawbacks of lower-carbon conference formats. To learn more about the logistics of conference organizing, we talked to 6 senior executive-level VIS organizers. We review some of the many considerations that go into planning, particularly with regard to how they influence decisions about alternative formats. We aim to start a discussion about the sustainability of VIS -- including sustainability for finance, volunteers, and, central to this work, the environment -- for the next three years and the next three hundred years.",,,,,"We present FishLense, an interactive tool to visually explore large  knowledge graphs and identify interesting nodes and patterns. FishLense offers smooth transitions from small- to large-scale graph exploration and a ``click-it-all'' interface that lowers the learning curve. FishLense demonstrates these design patterns at the example of a large-scale fishing knowledge graph.","Undertaking the visual exploration of a large knowledge graph in the domain of illegal fishery activities, FishHook offers an interactive visual analytics solution for scrutinizing individual entities via four distinct views: the Ego Net view, the Hierarchical Tree view, the Unity Net view, and the Parallel Coordinates view. The system incorporates an anomalous pattern detection mechanism, which is designed to address the challenges detailed in the 2023 IEEE VAST Challenge MC1. This integrated solution not only demonstrates robustness and scalability but also provides a powerful tool for comprehending large-scale knowledge graph datasets.","To solve the VAST Challenge 2023 MC3, our team employed a large language model, ChatGPT, to explore the potential of AI-guided visual analytics for the detection of anomalies within a knowledge graph in the context of illegal fishing and marine trade. We employed a systematic and iterative approach, guided by GPT augmentation, that enabled problem understanding, data processing, solution explo- ration, code writing, and results analysis. By generating and analyz- ing various graphs, we identified anomalies related to revenue and product services. Further analyses unveiled potential illegal fishing activities and identified instances warranting additional investigation. Overall, our work highlights both the strengths and limitations of ChatGPT in aiding the visual analytics process and emphasizes the importance of human judgment in refining AI-generated outputs.","Given an incomplete dataset, FishEye employs various tools, including artificial intelligence, to propose links that enhance the dataset. This paper addresses the challenge of identifying the most reliable tools for completing a knowledge graph. Additionally, the paper tackles the issue of identifying companies potentially involved in illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing. To aid in this endeavor, we introduce a web application designed to detect temporal patterns associated with companies that halt operations and reemerge with new identities. By aggregating data monthly and strategically displaying AI-generated bundle nodes using dropdown controls, our analysis uncovers suspicious patterns, particularly within the Chub Mackerel context. Notably, the Shark and Lichen bundles emerge as dependable graph-completion tools. The overlap between generated data and the knowledge graph in these two bundles underscores the reliability of predictions.",,,,,,,,,,,,"We describe the design process and the challenges we met during a rapid multi-disciplinary pandemic project related to stay-at-home orders and social media moral frames. Unlike our typical design experience, we had to handle a steeper learning curve, emerging and continually changing datasets, as well as under-specified design requirements, persistent low visual literacy, and an extremely fast turnaround for new data ingestion, prototyping, testing and deployment. We describe the lessons learned through this experience.","Visual analytics tools can help illustrate the spread of infectious diseases and enable informed decisions on epidemiological and public health issues. To create visualisation tools that are intuitive, easy to use, and effective in communicating information, continued research and development focusing on user-centric and methodological design models is extremely important. As a contribution to this topic, this paper presents the design and development process of the visual analytics application ESID (Epidemiological Scenarios for Infectious Diseases ). ESID is a visual analytics tool aimed at projecting the future developments of infectious disease spread using reported and simulated data based on sound mathematical-epidemiological models. The development process involved a collaborative and participatory design approach with project partners from diverse scientific fields. The findings from these studies, along with the guidelines derived from them, played a pivotal role in shaping the visualisation tool.","The COVID-19 pandemic has been a period where time-series of disease statistics, such as the number of cases or vaccinations, have been intensively used by public health professionals to estimate how their region compares to others and estimate what future could look like at home. Conventional visualizations are often limited in terms of advanced comparative features and in supporting forecasting systematically. This paper presents a visual analytics approach to support data-driven prediction based on a search-analyze-predict process comprising a multi-metric, multi-criteria time-series search method and a data-driven prediction technique. These are supported by a visualization framework for the comprehensive comparison of multiple time-series. We inform the design of our approach by getting iterative feedback from public health experts globally, and evaluate it both quantitatively and qualitatively.",,,,,"Biomedical research is highly data-driven. Domain experts need to learn how to interpret complex data visualizations to gain insights. They often need help interpreting data visualizations as they are not part of their training. Integrating visualization onboarding concepts into visual analytics (VA) tools can support users in interpreting, reading, and extracting information from visual presentations. In this paper, we present the design of the onboarding concept for an interactive VA tool to analyze large scaled biological data, particularly high-throughput screening (HTS) data. We evaluated our onboarding design by conducting a cognitive walkthrough and interviews with thinking aloud. We also collected data on domain experts’ visualization literacy. The results of the cognitive walkthrough showed that domain experts positively commented on the onboarding design and proposed adjusting smaller aspects. The interviews showed that domain experts are well-trained in interpreting basic visualizations (e.g., scatterplot, bar chart, line chart). However, they need support correctly interpreting the data visualized in the scatterplot, as they are new to them. Another important insight was fitting the onboarding messages into the domain’s language.","Annotations play a vital role in visualizations, providing valuable insights and focusing attention on critical visual elements.This study analyzes a curated corpus of 72 professionally designed static charts with annotations from prominent US news portals includingThe New York Times, The Economists, The Wall Street Journal, and The Washington Post. The analysis employed a qualitative approach involving identifying annotation types, assessing their frequency, exploring annotation combinations, categorizing text quantity, and examining the relationship between chart captions and annotations. The analysis reveals common patterns in annotation strategies used by professionals, including extensive use of annotations aligned with chart captions, targeted highlighting and descriptive text within charts, strategic utilization of multiple annotations as ensembles, and emphasis on article-related numerical values. These findings provide valuable guidance for improving annotation practices, tools, and methodologies, enhancing data comprehension and communication in visualizations.","In this paper, we reflect on the educational challenges and research opportunities in running data visualization design activities in the context of large courses. With the increasing number and sizes of data visualization course, we need to better understand approaches to scaling our teaching efforts. We draw on experiences organizing and facilitating activities primarily based on one instance of a master's course given to about 130 students. We provide a detailed account of the course with particular focus on the purpose, structure, and outcome of six two-hour design activities. Based on this, we reflect on three aspects of the course: First, how the course scale led us to thoroughly plan, evaluate, and revise communication between students, teaching assistants, and lecturers. Second, how we designed learning scaffolds through the design activities, and the reflections we received from students on this matter. Finally, we reflect on the diversity of the students that followed the course, the visualization exercises we used, the projects they worked on, and when to key in on simple boring problems and data sets. Thus, our paper contributes with discussions about balancing topical diversity, scaling courses to many students, and problem-based learning.",Designing courses that are taken by diverse student audiences is complicated by differing technical backgrounds and desired future roles. One proposed approach to course design bundles course assignments into parallel tracks for students to self-select and complete. An initial set of three tracks of computing laboratory-based assignments were developed and tested in the classroom. Each track option utilized different visualization software and libraries with a range of expected pre-requisite knowledge and technical abilities. Student and instructor reflections on the approach reinforced the suitability of a track-based course design to fulfill course objectives towards the education of diverse audiences.,"D3 is a popular library for implementing data visualizations, and is often taught in data visualization classes. However, D3 can be difficult to learn, and it can be especially challenging to make use of online examples, which often require changes to work in standalone JavaScript. We have previously taught D3 using guided tutorials, but found that students struggled to apply what they had learned to other visualization types or contexts. To address this, we introduced a new assignment type: choose-your-own labs. In each lab, students implemented a visualization technique from that week’s lecture. We provided a code sample and asked students to get the code sample working in the latest version of D3 as a standalone webpage, sometimes with a new dataset. This paper reflects on our experiences using this new assignment. Although students seemed to find the process of debugging real-world example D3 code to be tedious, they generally responded well to the assignment. We also observed that the quality and creativity of the final group projects in the class were improved from previous iterations of the course. We provide suggestions for educators who want to use a similar format in their courses, and provide our materials at https://osf.io/47vfy/?view_only=7e478a23e3e5414086569694279d38fe.","This paper discusses the potential of comics for explaining concepts with and around data visualization. With the increasing spread of visualizations and the democratization of access to visualization tools, we see a growing need for easily approachable resources for learning visualization techniques, applications, design processes, etc. Comics are a promising medium for such explanation as they concisely combine graphical and textual content in a sequential manner and they provide fast visual access to specific parts of the explanations. Based on a first literature review and our extensive experience with the subject, we survey works at the respective intersections of comics, visualization and education: data comics, educational comics, and visualization education. We report on five potentials of comics to create and share educational material, to engage wide and potentially diverse audiences, and to support educational activities. For each potential we list, we describe open questions for future research. Our discussion aims to inform both the application of comics by educators and their extension and study by researchers.","Integrating visualization onboarding methods into visual analytics tools presents challenges for designers and developers. These challenges include the varying complexity of visualization techniques, data types, and users’ expertise levels. Selecting and integrating educational theories, ensuring the completeness and clarity of onboarding instructions, choosing the appropriate medium, and determining interaction techniques for exploration during onboarding are also problematic. However, there needs to be established design guidance specifically focused on visualization onboarding. Existing resources like VisGuides and design patterns offer some qualitative advice but lack scientific foundations. To address this gap, we propose nine design actions based on critical reflections of empirical studies, the development of a design space, and user studies. These design actions emphasize customizing onboarding experiences to address users’ knowledge gaps, finding a balance between flexibility and structure, and incorporating concrete examples while considering potential limitations in knowledge transfer. Furthermore, we explore the connections, issues, and contradictions within the design actions. In conclusion, it is crucial to tailor onboarding experiences, balance flexibility and structure, and provide concrete examples while acknowledging knowledge transfer challenges.","To derive narratives from data, several journalistic abilities are required, including the skill to discover and construct compelling stories (data storytelling), employ data-driven techniques to research and analyze information (data literacy), utilize visualization methods effectively (visualization literacy), and approaching data with a combination of creativity and critical thinking. Despite their expertise in journalism, journalists often encounter challenges in comprehending and utilizing novel visual representations or understanding data analysis methods. The main objective of the dAn-oNo learning environment is to guide journalists through the data analytics process by removing coding hurdles and allowing them to experiment with and understand the code. The learning environment utilizes a Jupyter notebook with Markdown sections and incorporates a step-by-step approach, covering various stages of the data analytics workflow, such as data importing, inspection, statistical analysis, and in-depth analysis. The learning environment also includes an automated profiler that translates warnings and information into human-understandable insights. The design and implementation of the dAn-oNo learning environment were informed by a literature review, user research, interviews with Austrian data journalists, a phase of exploring different technical possibilities for the learning environment, and rapid prototyping. The prototype is accessible here: https://github.com/stemrich/SEVA\_DA-Onboarding-Tool","This paper presents an empirical evaluation of the performance of the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) model in Harvard’s CS171 data visualization course. While previous studies have focused on GPT’s ability to generate code for visualizations, this study goes beyond code generation to evaluate GPT’s abilities in various visualization tasks, such as data interpretation, visualization design, visual data exploration, and insight communication. The evaluation utilized GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 through the APIs of OpenAI to complete assignments of CS171, and included a quantitative assessment based on the established course rubrics, a qualitative analysis informed by the feedback of three experienced graders, and an exploratory study of GPT’s capabilities in completing border visualization tasks. Findings show that GPT-4 scored 80% on quizzes and homework, and Teaching Fellows could distinguish between GPT- and human-generated homework with 70% accuracy. The study also demonstrates GPT’s potential in completing various visualization tasks, such as data cleanup, interaction with visualizations, and insight communication. The paper concludes by discussing the strengths and limitations of GPT in data visualization, potential avenues for incorporating GPT in broader visualization tasks, and the need to redesign visualization education.","As the professional field of data visualization grows, so does the importance of preparing students effectively for the demands of real-world practice. Computing education has historically sought to teach and evaluate abstract knowledge (e.g., theories, principles, guidelines, design patterns) and the application of such knowledge to given problems. However, situations faced in professional practice are often messy, dynamic, and uncertain, and do not lend themselves well to the clear and direct application of such knowledge. This leaves a gap between the knowledge learned in the classroom and what is required for skillful practice in professional settings. In this paper, I discuss some historical reasons for this dominant pedagogical perspective, some of the core features of professional practice that are not typically taught in classrooms, and ways in which data visualization design can be taught to be more resonant with the experience of professional practice.","Whilst the visual arts is a very practical and tangible field, data visualisation is a combination of programming skills, data science and design theory. Each of these can be taught in a variety of ways, from traditional methods of lectures to technical programming classes or even asynchronous worksheets. The challenge is how to cover all of the required content within the constraints of the teaching period, environment, delivery method and ensuring the appropriate activities and assessment tasks. In this paper we reflect on the past 8 years of delivering the postgraduate unit ‘Data Exploration and Visualisation’ at Monash University. We present the four different ways that the same content has been taught to different cohorts, through a combination of on-campus lectures, large-format workshops, small group tutorials and online or hybrid tutorials and workshops, as well as various readings, videos and asynchronous activities. We explain the different external and internal requirements set for the teaching and describe the adaption of the teaching methods and assessments in order to meet these conditions. We reflect on our experiences of teaching multiple methods across different formats from very small to very large student cohorts.","New web technologies have enabled the deployment of powerful GPU-based computational pipelines that run entirely in the web browser, opening a new frontier for accessible scientific visualization applications. However, these new capabilities do not address the memory constraints of lightweight end-user devices encountered when attempting to visualize the massive data sets produced by today’s simulations and data acquisition systems. In this paper, we propose a novel implicit isosurface rendering algorithm for interactive visualization of massive volumes within a small memory footprint. We achieve this by progressively traversing a wavefront of rays through the volume and decompressing blocks of the data on-demand to perform implicit ray-isosurface intersections. The progressively rendered surface is displayed after each pass to improve interactivity. Furthermore, to accelerate rendering and increase GPU utilization, we introduce speculative ray-block intersection into our algorithm, where additional blocks are traversed and intersected speculatively along rays as other rays terminate to exploit additional parallelism in the workload. Our entire pipeline is run in parallel on the GPU to leverage the parallel computing power that is available even on lightweight end-user devices. We compare our algorithm to the state of the art in low-overhead isosurface extraction and demonstrate that it achieves 1.7×–5.7× reductions in memory overhead and up to 8.4× reductions in data decompressed.","High performance computing has played a pivotal and ongoing role in the field of computational fluid dynamics, enabling the simulation of increasingly larger-scale models. However, this rapid growth in model and simulation size has outpaced the capabilities of input/output (I/O) operations. Consequently, the conventional approach of saving and outputting data to persistent storage for analysis has become increasingly challenging, limiting the benefits of these advanced models. To address this challenge, we present a method for effectively handling massive-scale simulation data, ensuring its persistence at full spatial and temporal resolution for flexible post hoc analysis. We employ an in situ approach that captures interprocess communicated data, compressing cached data to a fraction of the overall simulation domain. We successfully reconstruct subdomains at full spatial and temporal resolution during post-processing through communication-free rerun using the cached halos. We detail the storage requirements of the new approach and demonstrate the substantial reductions in computational resources required to precisely recapitulate data within a local region of interest.","As the compute capabilities of the modern supercomputers continue to rise, domain scientists are able to run their simulations at very fine spatial and temporal resolutions. Compared to the compute speeds, the I/O bandwidth continues to lag by orders of magnitude. This necessitates that the analysis and data reduction are performed in situ while the simulation generated data is still at the supercomputer memory. Recently, intelligent data-driven sampling schemes have been proposed by visualization researchers. These sampling methods are scalable, in situ capable and able to identify the feature regions of the data. Although powerful, these sampling schemes need to traverse through the data sets at least twice, which can become problematic as the simulations start to touch the exascale capabilities. In this paper, we propose to use a reinforcement learning-based approach to devise a sub-linear time sampling algorithm. Using multi-arm bandits, we show that we can identify samples that are of similar or better quality compared to the existing methods while only touching a small fraction of the original data. We use multiple simulation data sets to show the efficacy of our proposed method.","We present a parallel, distributed-memory technique that enhances traditional ray-casting volume rendering of large data sets to highlight the depth and perception of interesting volumetric features. The technique introduces a lighting system that accounts for global shadows across distributed MPI nodes while using shared-memory parallelism within each node to compute shading information efficiently. The first stage of the approach involves estimating energy attenuation from a point light source through the global volume, using a reduced spatial resolution representation of the volume, with minimal global communication between nodes. It is then used in the second stage during volume rendering to shade sample points captured during ray-casting, generating a high-quality image. In this work, we study the technique's performance across varying spatial resolutions of the estimated light attenuation using synthetic and real-world volumetric data sets on distributed systems.","We investigate a data model for adaptive refinement in multivariate functional approximation of scientific data, based on a mesh of varying-resolution tensor products, and offering reduced size compared with a single tensor product representation. The mesh of tensor products adjoins in irregular fashion to tessellate the entire domain, with high-degree continuity across tensor product boundaries. The result is that regions of refinement, with additional knots and control points, are localized to individual tensor products rather than extending throughout the entire domain. The model attains similar accuracy with fewer total control points than a single tensor product model, at the cost of added computational complexity to manage the continuity and accuracy across tensor products. We describe our high-dimensional data organization and demonstrate how to approximate scientific datasets using our data model. Size and speed are compared between a single tensor product and our representation. Initial results demonstrate correct functionality and modest reduction in the number of control points required to attain comparable accuracy as a single tensor, with increased computation time as expected. Our initial findings indicate two avenues for future research: additional tuning of the adaptive refinement algorithm to reduce size further, and accelerating computation through parallelism.",,"We present a visual analytics framework, PepProEx, for unraveling peptide and protein interactions. In the framework, users can understand holistic trends, discover patterns, and get insights from the peptide/protein intensity data. Our framework provides multiple linked views to navigate intricate tissue/cancer-related dynamics. We enable researchers to shift effortlessly from an overview of the input data to granular statistical insights.","The complexity of protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks often leads to visual clutter and limited interpretability. To overcome these problems, we present ProtEGOnist, a novel, interactive visualization approach designed to explore PPI networks with a focus on drug-protein associations. ProtEGOnist addresses the challenges by introducing the concept of ego-graphs to represent local PPI neighborhoods around proteins of interest. These ego-graphs are aggregated into an ego-graph network, where edges between ego-graphs encoded their similarity using the Jaccard index. Our proposed visualization design offers an overview of drug-associated proteins, radar charts to compare protein functions, and detailed ego-graph subnetworks for interactive exploration. Our aim was to reduce visual complexity while enabling detailed exploration, facilitating the discovery of meaningful patterns in PPI networks. A web-based prototype of ProtEGOnist is available for interactive use.",,,,,,,"Contextual word embeddings -- high-dimensional vectors that encode the semantic similarity between words -- are proven to be effective for diverse natural language processing applications. These embeddings originate in large language models and are updated throughout the model's architecture (i.e., the model's layers). Given their intricacy, the explanation of embedding characteristics and limitations -- their contextualization -- has emerged as a widely investigated research subject. To provide an overview of the existing explanation methods and motivate researchers to design new approaches, we present a descriptive framework that connects data, features, tasks, and users involved in the word embedding explanation process. We use the framework as theoretical groundwork and implement a data processing pipeline that we use to solve three different tasks related to word embedding contextualization. These tasks enable answering questions about the encoded context properties in the embedding vectors, captured semantic concepts and their similarity, and masked-prediction meaningfulness and their relation to embedding characteristics. We show that divergent research questions can be analyzed by combining different data curation methods with a similar set of features.","In the rapidly evolving domain of artificial intelligence, Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT have made remarkable advancements, revolutionizing how users consume and generate content. The current research on LLM-based generative tools has primarily been concentrated on the generation of text, codes, or images. This paper presents an investigation into the application of LLMs for automating the creation of data visualizations from natural language queries. The proposed approach leverages LLMs for generating data queries, coupling this capability with a pattern matching strategy aimed at creating visualizations ( eventually auto-generated dashboards) based on the extracted data. Furthermore, we introduce a novel domain-specific data visualization language (DVL). This DVL can be effortlessly translated into executable code compatible with various data visualization libraries. This exploration into the confluence of visualization, NLP, and human-computer interaction, is substantiated by our work in a practical industrial context, enriching a live product. Our findings aspire to contribute to the ongoing dialogue of how NLP techniques and interactive visualizations can be harmonized to bolster data-driven communication and analytical discourse.","Exploratory analysis of public-generated short free-form online text often plays a critical role in facilitating decision-making across various domains. Particularly, in the civic domain, analyzing and understanding the thoughts, opinions, and comments shared by the public on social media or online engagement platforms on various civic issues are crucial for tracking consensus and making informed policy decisions. However, the public inputs are often short, redundant, unstructured, and full of nuances and ambiguity with a lack of clear boundary between positive and negative stances, which demands significant time and effort to analyze. Coupled with a lack of guidelines to visualize short free-form text, designing visualizations to show meaningful insights from public input while preserving the context and semantic values remains a challenging task. In this work, we explored discourse acts as a fine-grained categorization to characterize public input beyond positive or negative stances. Furthermore, we applied McDonald's greedy approximation of global inference to prioritize the relevance and negate the redundancy present in the text. We integrated these approaches with an interactive prototype called Matryona that employs visualization techniques to provide a contextual summary of unstructured public input and enables multilayered exploration from different angles by controlling the information content. Our initial evaluation of the prototype suggests Matryona's potential for reducing ambiguity and eliciting nuances present in the short free-form text by using discourse acts and accelerating the analysis process by ranking text comments.","Causal networks are widely used in many fields, including epidemiology, social science, medicine, and engineering, to model the complex relationships between variables. While it can be convenient to algorithmically infer these models directly from observational data, the resulting networks are often plagued with erroneous edges. Auditing and correcting these networks may require domain expertise frequently unavailable to the analyst. We propose the use of large language models such as ChatGPT as an auditor for causal networks. Our method presents ChatGPT witha causal network, one edge at a time, to produce insights about edge directionality, possible confounders, and mediating variables. We ask ChatGPT to reflect on various aspects of each causal link and we then produce visualizations that summarize these viewpoints for the human analyst to direct the edge, gather more data, or test further hypotheses. We envision a system where large language models, automated causal inference, and the human analyst and domain expert work hand in hand as a team to derive holistic and comprehensive causal models for any given case scenario. This paper presents first results obtained with an emerging prototype.","Topics of disadvantage are often discussed in the media. The discourse of disadvantage is multidimensional and has many intersecting elements, with some issues more common than others (e.g. violence, addiction), and some tending to co-occur, like human rights, criminal justice, and health to name just a few common themes. Here, we introduce and describe “Discourse Lines”, an online interactive visualisation to discover which co-occurring disadvantage issues are being discussed in the media, and which ones are left out and obscured. The visualisation presents an AI-assisted analysis of news articles on topics of discourse. Our multi-scale architecture metro map visualisation invites users to drill down from a topics overview landing map to topic-specific metro maps until individual news articles. This dynamic platform allows users to see how discourse on topics of disadvantage unfolds and how news conflates or separates various issues over time.","Text Style Transfer (TST) retains semantic content while modifying stylistic features. Exploratory visualization of LLM-generated TST via semantically aligned text visualization reveals advanced stylistic techniques such as use of metaphors. LLM style inquiry can be used to articulate advanced stylistic devices such as interjections, idioms and rhetorical devices and visually depicted as multivariate style heatmaps.","The breadth and depth of knowledge learned by Large Language Models (LLMs) can be assessed through repetitive prompting and visual analysis of commonality across the responses. We show levels of LLM verbatim completions of prompt text through aligned responses, mind-maps of knowledge across several areas in general topics, and an association graph of topics generated directly from recursive prompting of the LLM.","There is a growing trend of utilizing Visualization-oriented Natural Language Interfaces (V-NLIs) to author charts. However, researchers consistently highlight the lack of high-quality chart and natural language datasets, which impedes the development of more sophisticated and data-driven systems using V-NLIs. In this study, we present a meticulously curated collection of human-generated 1,981 Vega-Lite specifications, derived from real-world data, and use Large Language Models (LLMs) for generating natural language queries for chart generation tasks. Unlike previous datasets that relied on relatively simple and homogeneous templates, our Vega-Lite dataset contains more complex and diverse (i.e., varying interactions, multiple plots/views, and different chart types). Using this dataset, we demonstrate generating natural language queries for chart generation, and how the results can be different when different input types are used (e.g., Vega-Lite, Image, both Vega-Lite and Image).","Electrical grids are geographical and topological structures whose voltage states are challenging to represent accurately and efficiently for visual analysis. The current common practice is to use colored contour maps, yet these can misrepresent the data. We examine the suitability of four alternative visualization methods for depicting voltage data in a geographically dense distribution system—Voronoi polygons, H3 tessellations, S2 tessellations, and a network-weighted contour map. We find that Voronoi tessellations and network-weighted contour maps more accurately represent the statistical distribution of the data than regular contour maps.","Extreme wind phenomena play a crucial role in the efficient operation of wind farms for renewable energy generation. However, existing detection methods are computationally expensive, limited to specific coordinate. In real-world scenarios, understanding the occurrence of these phenomena over a large area is essential. Therefore, there is a significant demand for a fast and accurate approach to forecast such events. In this paper, we propose a novel method for detecting wind phenomena using topological analysis, leveraging the gradient of wind speed or critical points in a topological framework. By extracting topological features from the wind speed profile within a defined region, we employ topological distance to identify extreme wind phenomena. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of utilizing topological features derived from regional wind speed profiles. We validate our approach using high-resolution simulations with the Weather Research and Forecasting model (WRF) over a month in the US East Coast.","Energy models can have a large impact on policy options and decarbonization pathways, however, they are currently stunted by obstacles including the need for transparency, accessibility of model inputs and outputs, increased stakeholder engagement, and open-source tools. The Energy Modeling Hub has responded to this need with the development of an integrated modeling platform consisting of (1) a Canadian database for energy systems, (2) a suite of energy system models, and (3) a visualization dashboard. This paper focuses on the requirements and development of a visualization dashboard used to facilitate scenario comparison, multi-model comparison, and the co-development of scenarios. The design consists of a series of tabs supporting side-by-side visualizations with a multitude of interactive features including a hover tool, toolbar, data filters, buttons, and an interactive legend. The dashboard has been used in presentations to Ministers in the British Colombia Government and received positive feedback for transparently displaying results and supplemental information as well as allowing users to interact with the data in a way that can drive their own decisions. The visualization dashboard serves as a solid foundation to facilitate scenario-based and multi-model comparisons and close the communication gap between energy modelers and stakeholders. Future work includes expanding the visualization and interactive elements implemented, specifically for input data visualization.","Immersive experiences can increase engagement and improve data understanding. We explore the use of virtual reality to visualise the complexities of electric networks and facilitate a greater understand- ing of net zero initiatives. We propose that an abstract metaphorical immersive experience can provide an intuitive overview of the complex components of energy networks and how they behave over time in response to fluctuating supply and demand in order to achieve stability and sustainability. This work aims to enable a variety of stakeholders to better understand and associate the complexities in the systems and be aware of the connections over time and space. Using the Monash University electric network system as a case study, we explore the network dynamics and fluctuations over time. The virtual reality experience allows users to view campus electricity assets and local and remote energy sources, as well as witness the dynamics of the network. Thus, the complexities of the energy system and its impact on sustainability can be more readily understood.","In this work, we discuss the design of visualizations for understand- ing the complex oscillatory dynamics of an island power system with renewable generation sources after the loss of a large oil power plant. As more renewable generation sources are added to power systems, the oscillatory dynamics will change, which requires new visualization techniques to determine causes and strategies to avoid unwanted behaviors in the future. Our approach integrates geo- graphic views, time-series plots, and novel oscillatory-trajectory curves, providing unique insights into the interdependent oscillatory behaviors of multiple state variables and generators over time. By enabling multi-node and multivariate comparisons over time, users can qualitatively determine drivers of oscillations and differences in generator dynamics, which is not possible with other commonly used visualization techniques.","This paper introduces an interactive visualisation that combines a spatial element to the single line diagram (SLD). SLDs are conceptual maps of the power network used by power engineers to understand the connectivity between assets of the network, study power flow, and maintain grid stability and security. Enabling users with varying degrees of electrical knowledge to understand the geographical aspect of the SLD was the key design goal. Developed through an iterative process, the visualisation intuitively transitions from an SLD view to a map view. Evaluation of the visualisation during, and following development revealed that the prototype was well-liked and that having a spatial element to the SLD was useful in understanding the geographical relationships in the power network. The evaluation also helped identify stakeholders with an interest in the hybrid view and showed the prototype’s potential utility in communicating technical data to electrical non-technical users.","The integration of data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence in urban studies and design promises transformative impacts on cities. While acknowledging that urban complexities transcend data, the concepts of datafication and dataism emphasize the potential to sample, model, and predict urban phenomena through data. This study explores the synergy of collaboration and data visualization in urban data governance. An analytical framework, rooted in the multidimensional collaboration model and guided by theories, elucidates dimensions like Governance, Administration, Autonomy, Mutuality, Norms, and Equality. A combination of qualitative and quantitative research complements the framework, generating indicators to assess the impact of data visualization on data governance. This study contributes to structuring the framework to examine the symbiotic relationship between data visualization, collaboration, and decision-making, propelling transformative urban data governance.",,"The process of geospatial data aggregation provides a means for abstracting the complexity of urban systems to not just better understand them, but also protect the privacy of the individuals within them. However, level of aggregation and the arbitrary sizes, shapes, and arrangements of areal units may lead to statistical and visual bias that affects the reliability and validity of findings derived from the analysis of areally aggregated urban data. This bias and resulting analytical uncertainty – known as the Modifiable Areal Unit Problem (MAUP) – has implications for public policy implementation and allocation of critical resources in both urban and rural areas. Despite a wealth of geographic research on MAUP and development of advanced statistical approaches to quantifying its effects, many of these insights and techniques remain largely inaccessible and subsequently unadopted by GIS professionals working on city planning applications. This paper introduces a simple vector-to-raster choropleth mapping workflow that enables a broad range of urban analysts to visually assess the scalar effects of the modifiable areal unit problem.",Sustainable mobility is crucial in our current era. Our proposed interactive web application provides a user-friendly way to evaluate public transport networks and analyze how well connected a user defined location is. The current implementation comprises data from all Austrian public transport systems but can be extended with data from any provider. We made the code available on github: github.com/jku-vds-lab/publictransport. The tool can be tested in the deployed version: publictransport.jku-vds-lab.at.,,,,,,,,,"Organizations of all kinds, whether public or private, profit-driven or non-profit, and across various industries and sectors, rely on dashboards for effective data visualization. However, the reliability and efficacy of these dashboards rely on the quality of the visual and data they present. Studies show that less than a quarter of dashboards provide information about their sources, which is just one of the expected metadata when provenance is seriously considered. Provenance is a record that describes people, organizations, entities, and activities that had a role in the production, influence, or delivery of a piece of data or an object. This paper aims to provide a provenance representation model, that entitles standardization, modeling, generation, capture, and visualization, specifically designed for dashboards and its visual and data components. The proposed model will offer a comprehensive set of essential provenance metadata that enables users to evaluate the quality, consistency, and reliability of the information presented on dashboards. This will allow a clear and precise understanding of the context in which a specific dashboard was developed, ultimately leading to better decision-making.","This paper proposes graphical representations of data and rationale provenance in workflows that convert both category labels and associated numeric data between distinct but semantically related taxonomies. We motivate the graphical representations with a new task abstraction, the cross-taxonomy transformation, and associated graph-based information structure, the crossmap. The task abstraction supports the separation of category recoding and numeric redistribution decisions from the specifics of data manipulation in ex-post data harmonisation. The crossmap structure is illustrated using an example conversion of numeric statistics from a country-specific taxonomy to an international classification standard. We discuss the opportunities and challenges of using visualisation to audit and communicate cross-taxonomy transformations and present candidate graphical representations.","We describe supporting near real-time situational awareness of the electric distribution system by visualizing novel data from voltage sensors deployed on existing broadband cable television network equipment. Our scalable web-based visual analytics platform supports interactive geospatial exploration, time-series analysis, and summarization of grid behavior during potentially anomalous events. The broadband cable television sensor network provides observability of the electrical distribution system at a higher local spatial resolution than is typically available to most utilities, revealing the operational state of the network and aiding in the detection of abnormal behaviors or deviations from expected patterns, particularly across electric utility service areas. We outline the design and development of interactive geospatial and time-series visualization components and the scalable data services that supply metadata, historical, and real-time streams of sensor data across the network. We present our platform during periods of extreme weather, demonstrating its ability to assist in detecting patterns of operation that affect power availability, quality, resiliency, and service restoration.","Embedded devices are pivotal in many aspects to our everyday life, acting as key elements within our critical infrastructures, e-health sector, and the IoT ecosystem. These devices ship with custom software, dubbed firmware, whose development may not have followed strict security-by-design guidelines and for which no detailed documentation may be available. Given their critical role, testing their software before deploying them is crucial. Software fuzzing is a popular software testing technique that has shown to be quite effective in the last decade. However, the firmware may contain thousands of subcomponents with unexpected interplays. Moreover, operators may have a tight time budget to perform a security evaluation, requiring focused fuzzing on the most critical subcomponents. Also, considering the lack of accurate documentation for a device, it is quite hard for a security operator to understand what to fuzz and how to fuzz a specific device firmware. In this paper, we present FuzzPlanner, a visual analytics solution that enables security operators during the design of a fuzzing campaign over a device firmware. FuzzPlanner helps the operator identify the best candidates for fuzzing using several innovative visual aids. Our contributions include introducing FuzzPlanner, exploring diverse analytical tools to pinpoint critical binaries, and showing its efficacy with two real-world firmware image scenarios.","Dealing with complex information regarding cyber security risks is increasingly important as attacks rise in frequency. Visualisation techniques are used to support decision-making and insight. However, the use of visualisations across different stakeholders and cyber security risk data is not well explored. This work presents an exploratory study in which participants use sketching to represent cyber-risk data. We critically discuss the method and our results demonstrate the usefulness of the method to identify new, diverse visualisation approaches, as well as the richness of stakeholder visualisation conceptualisation.","Passwords remain the most widely used form of user authentication, despite advancements in other methods. However, their limitations, such as susceptibility to attacks, especially weak passwords defined by human users, are well-documented. The existence of weak human-defined passwords has led to repeated password leaks from websites, many of which are of large scale. While such password leaks are unfortunate security incidents, they provide security researchers and practitioners with good opportunities to learn valuable insights from such leaked passwords, in order to identify ways to improve password policies and other security controls on passwords. Researchers have proposed different data visualisation techniques to help analyse leaked passwords. However, many approaches rely solely on frequency analysis, with limited exploration of distance-based graphs. This paper reports PassViz, a novel method that combines the edit distance with the t-SNE (t-distributed stochastic neighbour embedding) dimensionality reduction algorithm [19] for visualising and analysing leaked passwords in a 2-D space. We implemented PassViz as an easy-to-use command-line tool for visualising large-scale password databases, and also as a graphical user interface (GUI) to support interactive visual analytics of small password databases. Using the “000webhost” leaked database as an example, we show how PassViz can be used to visually analyse different aspects of leaked passwords and to facilitate the discovery of previously unknown password patterns. Overall, our approach empowers researchers and practitioners to gain valuable insights and improve password security through effective data visualisation and analysis.","The complexity of distributed manufacturing and software development coupled with the increasing prevalence of cyber and supply chain attacks necessitates a greater understanding of the hardware and software components that comprise equipment in critical infrastructure. When a vulnerability in a single software library can have disastrous consequences, being able to identify where that library may exist in equipment or software becomes a prerequisite for protecting the overall infrastructure. This need has sparked a large effort around the development and incorporation of bill-of-materials(BOM) into security, asset management, and procurement practices to aid in mitigating, and responding to future attacks. While much of the current research is devoted to creating BOMs, it is equally important to develop methods for comparing them to answer questions, such as: How has my software changed? Are two pieces of equipment equivalent? Does this piece of equipment that just arrived match my historical information? In this work, we demonstrate how BOMs can be represented by graph structures.  We then describe how these structures can be fed into a graph comparison algorithm to produce a novel interactive visualization that allows us to not only identify differences in BOMs but show exactly where they are in the product."

image_caption,"The image has 3 panels: (i)examples of affective visualization design projects; (ii)six identified genres of affective visualization design projects (interactive interface, video, static image/painting, installation, artifact, event), and (iii) the design space proposed by this work, showing WHERE to apply affective visualization design, WHAT design tasks it undertakes, and HOW to perform the design.",Our novel segmentation volume compression can be used to interactively render large data sets. The compression builds on a brick-wise hierarchical multi-grid of segmentation labels which are compactly stored as a stream of operations. Compression rates are between 1% and 3% on complex segmentation volumes.,"We conducted a longitudinal study during the 2022 U.S. midterm elections, investigating the real-world impacts of uncertainty visualizations. Using our forecast model of the governor elections in 33 states, we created a website and deployed four uncertainty visualizations for the election forecasts. Our online experiment ran from Oct. 18, 2022 to Nov. 23, 2022, involving 1,327 participants from 15 states. We find that election forecast visualizations can heighten emotions, increase trust, and slightly affect people’s intentions to participate in elections. Our qualitative analysis uncovers the complex political and social contexts of election forecast visualizations, showcasing that visualizations may provoke polarization.",The TimeSplines interface. Left: The canvas on which the idiosyncratic timelines are created and manipulated. Right: The data drawer which contains multiple heterogeneous datasets.,Topological analysis of vector field with discontinuity (transparent gray) exhibiting repelling sliding flow (red LIC). Qualitatively different equivalence streamsets (white) are separated by stable (blue) and unstable (red) manifolds. Equitrices (violet) separate streamsets of different dimensionality.,Fluid flow simulation visualized using line integral convolution and color coding of vorticity.   Inside the vortex lens observed line integral convolution is used to show a vortex at its actual position in space and time.,"This gridded glyphmap shows the proportions of population (x-axis) in each grid square, by age group (y-axis; youngest at top) in different COVID-19 infection states (hue).",,"The Semantic Subspace Explorer learns the semantic associations among data attributes, exposing interesting data patterns. The interface consists of:  the Control Panel, where users can determine the number of subspaces; the Semantic Space View, which visualizes the semantic space of all attributes; the Subspace Organizer, which shows an overview of the generated subspaces; the Subspace View which, shows a user-selected subspace in more detail as a biplot.","Illustration of how a differentially private algorithm generates private data from the original data. The data is binned through count queries, denoted F(x). Noise is added from Laplace distributions dictated by epsilon. The output is a differentially private scatterplot composed of F(x) + noise  = M(x).","The comparison between the way of estimating the perceptual variability in conducting visual clustering, i.e., cluster ambiguity, of monochrome scatterplots.",Guidelines to infer the Cluster-Label Matching (CLM) of the high-dimensional data based on the CLM of the embedded data (left column) and the scores given by Label-T (Trustworthiness) and Label-C (Continuity) (first row),"GIST is a Layout Adjustment method to improve data visibility in scatter plots where their visual representations overlap.  It searches for the optimal node diameters that enable to remove overlaps with a limited quantity of movements. To speed up the process and minimize movements, it tolerates some overlap that do not hinder the visualization.  On the top left side, the initial layout represents 10000 points of the Fashion-MNIST dataset projected by t-SNE. On the bottom right side, the layout is post-processed by GIST. Data visual representations remain large enough, the overlaping issues are solved, and the cluster shapes are preserved.",Analysis of color nameability in rainbow vs. other perceptual colormaps. This metric predicts the type of data features people attend to.,Changing the distribution on printed media though touch without electronic computation or power. Color changing ink is used that changes it's appearance from colored (right-top) to colorless (right-bottom) upon human touch. This changes the distribution (right-top to right-bottom) upon touch.,"Data Navigator provides visualization toolkits with rich, accessible navigation structures, robust input handling, and flexible, semantic rendering.",Examples of color palette refinement by NL2Color. (a)-(d) show four pairs of an original chart (left) and a new chart (right) refined by NL2Color according to the request. (e) shows an original chart (left) and three new charts (right) NL2Color generated according to three refinement requests. The color palette of each chart is displayed above the chart. The original charts are collected from Vega-Lite.,"Trajectories of taxi rides in Beijing: (a) A line-based visualization of the trajectories is cluttered and convoluted; (b) Using a density plot eliminates clutter, but the continuation of the trends is ambiguous, e.g., it looks like taxis follow the prominent, circular route around the city center; (c) Pixel-based colorization reveals clusters, we see that taxis mostly stay in one part of the city.","Teaser with 3 composite images. Image A shows a mockup of the tactual plot technique. Image B shows a screenshot of the TactualPlot system implemented on an iPad.

Scrollytelling is a recent visual storytelling technique extensively used on the web, where content appears or changes as users scroll up or down a page. By employing the familiar gesture of scrolling as its primary interaction mechanism, it provides users with a sense of control, exploration and discoverability while still offering a simple and intuitive interface. In this paper, we present a novel approach for authoring, editing, and presenting data-driven scientific narratives using scrollytelling. Our method flexibly integrates common sources such as images, text, and video, but also supports more specialized visualization techniques such as interactive maps as well as scalar field and mesh data visualizations.

Spurious associations, including Simpson's paradox, are prevalent in observational studies. E.g., in a study that investigates the effect of a job training program, the cause (training program) and outcome (earnings) can be distorted by a third variable (ethnicity), leading to a misleading interpretation of the causal effect.

The system incorporates a suite of statistical techniques, algorithms, and visual components to help identify causal roots of spurious associations, as well as modules to reason about association paradox and to make informed decisions.","How do professional statisticians use data visualization?

Recently, several end-to-end deep learning models have been proposed to address the OWOD problem. However, these approaches face several challenges: a) significant changes in both network architecture and training procedure are required; b) they are trained from scratch, which can not leverage existing pre-trained general detectors; c) costly annotations for all unknown classes are needed. To overcome these challenges, we present a visual analytic framework called OW-Adapter. It acts as an adaptor to enable pre-trained general object detectors to handle the OWOD problem. Specifically, OW-Adapter is designed to identify, summarize, and annotate unknown examples with minimal human effort. Moreover, we introduce a lightweight classifier to learn newly annotated unknown classes and plug the classifier into pre-trained general detectors to detect unknown objects. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework through two case studies of different domains, including common object recognition and autonomous driving. The studies show that a simple yet powerful adaptor can extend the capability of pre-trained general detectors to detect unknown objects and improve the performance on known classes simultaneously.","​This work makes three contributions: (1) We adapt a question-answering paradigm to study fine-grained recallability of information visualisations.

In this case, features are based on the sublevel set filtration of pathology images with class labels (Gleason grade) that define the progression of prostate cancer~\cite{lawson2019persistent}. Knowing which features are important for each class is commonly an educated guess with the lifetime of a feature (persistence) often assumed to define importance. (b) Our approach, based on a learned metric classifier, takes as input the unweighted density of persistence points and reweighs this density based on what best defines a class. This allows us to build a field of importance for regions of a diagram. (c) This importance field can be used to create visualizations to illuminate which features drive a classification. For example, it can highlight what points are important directly in a diagram or, in the case of sublevel set filtrations, visualize the important structure directly in an image. Consider that a hallmark of prostate cancer is gland degeneration as the disease progresses.  Calcifications (red arrow) are only present in well-structured glands and are highlighted as important structures for Gleason 3, an earlier stage of the disease.","Illustration of the improvements of unconstrained edit distances over constrained edit distances on the TOSCA ensemble: two embedded mappings of critical points are shown on the left, the same mappings in a typical merge tree layout on the right.

This network includes over 24,000 junctions, or buses, each with a given voltage at a single snapshot in time. Here, we surrounded each bus with a Voronoi polygon. The electrical state of the network is represented by coloring each polygon by the bus voltage. A blue-white-red diverging color scale shows deviations from the expected voltage. Giving each bus its own polygon increases the fidelity of the visualization to the real data distribution by avoiding averaging. We explore this and other alternatives to contour visualizations for power systems data.","Extreme wind phenomena play a crucial role in the efficient operation of wind farms for renewable energy generation. However, existing detection methods are computationally expensive, limited to specific coordinate. In real-world scenarios, understanding the occurrence of these phenomena over a large area is essential. Therefore, there is a significant demand for a fast and accurate approach to forecast such events. In this paper, we propose a novel method for detecting wind phenomena using topological analysis, leveraging the gradient of wind speed or critical points in a topological framework. By extracting topological features from the wind speed profile within a defined region, we employ topological distance to identify extreme wind phenomena. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of utilizing topological features derived from regional wind speed profiles.
